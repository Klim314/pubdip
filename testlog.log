The influence of these hydrolase activities on Escherichia coli ATCC 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. After the incubation of E. coli with SLPs, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. All of these results suggested that the SLPs of both L. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to E. coli cells.')

4 ('>T', 'TI  - Cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.', 'AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. Combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. METHODS: Probiotic cultures were inoculated into MRS broth adjusted to pH 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Survivors of pH 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh MRS broth and incubated at 55 degrees C for 2 h. The cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. The adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. The combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. Viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium longum LMG 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. However, for B. longum Bb46 and B. bifidum LMG 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. A cocktail containing L. plantarum + B. longum Bb46 + B. longum LMG 13197 best inhibited S. aureus while E. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing L. acidophilus La14 150B + B. longum Bb46 + B. bifidum LMG 11041. A cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. CONCLUSION: Multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.')

A total of 150 piglets (initial body weight (BW) 7.53 +/- 0.21 kg) were allotted to one of the following diets, including a basal diet, a basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg Flavomycin, or basal diet plus 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 % L. acidophilus. On day 28 of the trial, the pigs were given an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (200 mug/kg body weight) followed by blood collection 3 h later. Diets with either antibiotics, 0.1 or 0.2 % Lactobacillus increased (P < 0.05) the final BW and decreased (P < 0.05) feed gain ratio (F/G) compared with the control group. Pigs fed diets containing antibiotic or Lactobacillus had greater average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05) than pigs fed the control diet. The rectal content Lactobacillus counts for pigs fed diet containing Lactobacillus were significant higher (P < 0.01) than those fed antibiotic or control diet. Feeding the Lactobacillus diets decreased the Escherichia coli counts of rectal content (P < 0.01). Pigs fed diets containing 0.1 or 0.2 % Lactobacillus decreased serum DAO activity (P < 0.05) compared with pigs fed the control diet. Serum IL-10 concentration was enhanced in pigs fed the diet with Lactobacillus compared to pigs fed the control diet and antibiotic diet. Feeding a diet with Lactobacillus reduced (P < 0.05) IFN-gamma concentration compared to the control diet. Inclusion of Lactobacillus in diets fed to pigs reduced TNF-alpha concentration compared with pigs fed no Lactobacillus (P < 0.05).

12 ('>T', 'TI  - Functional characterization of probiotic surface layer protein-carrying Lactobacillus amylovorus strains.', 'AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesiveness to intestinal epithelium, beneficial immunomodulating effects and the production of pathogen-inhibitory compounds are generally considered as beneficial characteristics of probiotic organisms. We showed the potential health-promoting properties and the mechanisms of probiotic action of seven swine intestinal Lactobacillus amylovorus isolates plus the type strain (DSM 20531T) by investigating their adherence to porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-1) and mucus as well as the capacities of the strains to i) inhibit the adherence of Escherichia coli to IPEC-1 cells, ii) to produce soluble inhibitors against intestinal pathogens and iii) to induce immune signaling in dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, the role of the L. amylovorus surface (S) -layers - symmetric, porous arrays of identical protein subunits present as the outermost layer of the cell envelope - in adherence to IPEC-1 cells was assessed using a novel approach which utilized purified cell wall fragments of the strains as carriers for the recombinantly produced S-layer proteins. RESULTS: Three of the L. amylovorus strains studied adhered to IPEC-1 cells, while four strains inhibited the adherence of E. coli, indicating additional mechanisms other than competition for binding sites being involved in the inhibition. None of the strains bound to porcine mucus. The culture supernatants of all of the strains exerted inhibitory effects on the growth of E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria and Yersinia, and a variable, strain-dependent induction was observed of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human DCs. L. amylovorus DSM 16698 was shown to carry two S-layer-like proteins on its surface in addition to the major S-layer protein SlpA. In contrast to expectations, none of the major S-layer proteins of the IPEC-1 -adhering strains mediated bacterial adherence. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated adhesive and significant pathogen inhibitory efficacies among the swine intestinal L. amylovorus strains studied, pointing to their potential use as probiotic feed supplements, but no independent role could be demonstrated for the major S-layer proteins in adherence to epithelial cells. The results indicate that many intestinal bacteria may coexist with and confer benefits to the host by mechanisms not attributable to adhesion to epithelial cells or mucus.')

However, reports on the influences of bLf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. We examined the effects of apo-bLf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/mL) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. We found that bLf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/mL) retarded the growth rate of Bifidobacterium bifidum (ATCC 29521), B. longum (ATCC 15707), B. lactis (BCRC 17394), B. infantis (ATCC 15697), Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272), L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103), and L. coryniformis (ATCC 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. Otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 128 or >128 mg/mL against B. bifidum, B. longum, B. lactis, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103). With regard to MICs, bLf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. Intriguingly, bLf (>0.25 mg/mL) significantly enhanced the growth of Rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) and L. acidophilus (BCRC 14065) by approximately 40-200 %, during their late periods of growth. Supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of L. acidophilus reduced the growth of Escherichia coli by about 20 %. Thus, bLf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. An antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.')

Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM - OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 10(9) CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.')

A total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex Ross 308 broilers with an initial average BW of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. Dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (CON), (2) CON + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) CON + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (P1), and (4) CON + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (P2). Broilers fed the P1 and P2 diets had greater BW gain than broilers fed the CON diet during d 22 to 35 (P = 0.01) and overall (P = 0.02). Feed conversion ratios in P1 and P2 were decreased (P = 0.03) compared with that in CON from d 22 to 35. Ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of His and Phe, were increased (P < 0.05) in P1 and P2 compared with CON.

Ability of lactobacilli to produce H2O2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. Lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. Lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of M. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of E. coli in Endo medium and L. acidophilus--in MRS medium. RESULTS: Decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. This effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against E. coli and decrease against L. acidophilus. The degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them.

One hundred H. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-H. pylori therapy plus probiotics of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-H. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. After 6-week treatment, (1)(3)C-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. Quantitative PCR with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the H. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, P < 0.05). B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and E. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. The number of B. bifidum and L. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment.

47 ('>T', 'TI  - Comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.', 'AB  - PURPOSE: Multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. We therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens Escherichia coli NCTC 9001 and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 00775. METHODS: We used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both pH-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. RESULTS: In the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, L. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against E. faecalis, L. fermentum the most inhibitory against E. coli. A commercially available mixture of 14 strains (Bio-Kult((R))) was the most effective mixture, against E. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against E. coli. Mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. In the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when pH was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral pH. CONCLUSIONS: Both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. Probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. Probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. Probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.')

The viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. All strains showed antimicrobial activity and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. Antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against Lactobacillus and Clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase K and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. The degree of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 adhesion on the surface of Caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 adhering to Caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli.

This study evaluated the effects of LAB inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees C) temperatures for 36 h. Trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to LAB utilization (P > 0.05). However, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (P < 0.05). Thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added LAB (P < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. Overall, LAB did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. Furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. Therefore, LAB can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.')

In the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. Cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. For bacteriocin production, Lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. Out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of Lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to Lactobacillus acidophilus. Both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C respectively. Suitable pH was 5.5 and 6.0 for Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. Bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees C for 60min. Function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in pH.

METHODS: Adhesion of L. acidophilus FN001 to mice Peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. The nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. The presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. The effect of L. acidophilus FN001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to Peyer's patches was also studied. RESULTS: The adhesion of L. acidophilus FN001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of D-mannose and methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. Pretreatment of L. acidophilus FN001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. L. acidophilus FN001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the L. acidophilus FN001 surface. In adhesion inhibition assay, L. acidophilus NF001, when applied to Peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of Escherichia coli ATCC25922 to Peyer's patches.

Importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-EPS was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. In addition, we found that adding r-EPS significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csgA, and csgB) and chemotaxis (cheY) in transcriptome analysis.

It is also important to note that the expression of MUC2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of L. acidophilus A4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which E. coli O157:H7 attached to epithelial cells. In addition, the mRNA levels of IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in HT-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with L. acidophilus A4 extracts. These results indicate that MUC2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of MUC2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of E. coli O157:H7.')

In this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among ETEC agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (SCS) from healthy infant stool. Only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal C2BBel (Caco-2) cell line. Isolate identification using API 50CHL strips showed that they belonged to different Lactobacillus species, i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2, Lactobacillus salivarius MM1 and Lactobacillus paracasei En4. The SCS still had an inhibitory effect on ETEC after heating (100 degrees C, 15 min). The lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the pH of SCS was adjusted to neutral (pH 7.2) to reduce the SCS inhibitory effect. Antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-SCS with ETEC suspension. After 4h of co-culture, ETEC growth was inhibited. This study suggests that L. acidophilus RY2, L. salivarius MM1 and L. paracasei En4 could be used as an effective control for ETEC.')

The characteristics of L. crispatus ZJ001 were compared to Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 from the same genus which also produces the S-layer proteins. The strain ZJ001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. Its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of S-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kDa in L. crispatus ZJ001. Removal of the S-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to HeLa cells. The functional role of the S-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the S-layer protein. The S-layer proteins from L. crispatus ZJ001 inhibited adhesion of S. typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 to HeLa cells. These results suggest that L. crispatus ZJ001 possesses probiotic properties and the S-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to HeLa cells.')

Characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the GIT and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. We found that growth of E. coli O157:H7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. Growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. In fecal suspensions, E. coli O157:H7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. However, a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited E. coli O157:H7 growth in fecal suspensions. The inhibitory effect was dose dependent.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were labelled by using methyl-1,2-[(3)H]-thymidine. The bacterial adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the mucus. The results showed that the abilities of Lactobacillus spp. to bind to the same intestinal mucus were higher than those of pathogenic Salmonella and E. coli. Pretreatment of intestinal mucus with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination, reduced the adhesion of the tested pathogens, but the reductive extent of pathogenic adhesion by Lactobacillus spp. in combination was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: The tested bacteria had different adhesions to mucus glycoproteins isolated from different intestinal regions of chicken. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit attachments of Salmonella and E. coli to chicken intestinal mucus than Lactobacillus sp. alone.

Colonization of ETEC in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. In the present study we have engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant K99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. The expression of K99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. To evaluate a function of the K99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. The tests showed that recombinant L. acidophilus, not control L. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against K99+ E. coli in a dose dependent manner.

Optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by L. acidophilus were pH 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, growth was higher in LAPTg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/Tween 80/glucose) broth than in MRS (De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe) broth.

Steers were evaluated for shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the DFMs, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. Composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. Feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the DFMs were fed. Gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. Lactobacillus acidophilus NPC 747 decreased (P < 0.01) the shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. E. coli O157:H7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving L. acidophilus NPC 747. In addition, DFM supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) the number of E. coli O157:H7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. Body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the DFM supplementation period did not differ among treatments. Gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (P < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two DFM treatments than for control animals. The results of this study suggest that the feeding of a Lactobacillus-based DFM to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.')

Two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. In the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by Gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. Bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting. All three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in vitro. Adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. HT-29, and Caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. With mucus-secreting cell-line HT29-MTX, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. The adhesion indices of L. acidophilus LA-1 and L. rhamnosus GG were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. We also investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli (strain O157:H7). Pre-treatment of E. coli O157:H7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from L. acidophilus HN017, L. rhamnosus DR20 and B. lactis DR10 reduced the culturable E. coli numbers on TSB plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain.

Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.')

The E. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. The fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when L. acidophilus SBT2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. The analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria.

DISCUSSION: RESULTS suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. Oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae), Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae), Lippia graveolens Kunth (Verbenaceae), and Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. Oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.')

('>F', 'TI  - Effects of Citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.', 'AB  - 1. The present study was conducted to develop Citrus junos probiotics (CJP), using by-products of Citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis. The effects of dietary CJP on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. A total of 240 one-day-old Ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g CJP/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg CJP significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg CJP, whereas the IgG and IgA concentration remained unaffected. In addition, 20 g/kg CJP significantly inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of Lactobacillus or Bacillus spp. 5. A significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary CJP. 6. Thus, the results suggest that CJP up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal E. coli and TBARS values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.')

METHODS AND RESULTS: Pure Ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (G37, G60 and C145 degrees C) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Impacts of Ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to Caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: DAPI, LIVE/DEAD staining and FISH. Examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of E. coli and Ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. Maillard reaction (MR, glycation) of Ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. Hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees C with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering E. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of Ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees C, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.')

('>F', 'TI - Secreted aspartic peptidases of Candida albicans liberate bactericidal hemocidins from human hemoglobin.', "AB  - Secreted aspartic peptidases (Saps) are a group of ten acidic hydrolases considered as key virulence factors of Candida albicans. These enzymes supply the fungus with nutrient amino acids as well as are able to degrade the selected host's proteins involved in the immune defense. Our previous studies showed that the human menstrual discharge is exceptionally rich in bactericidal hemoglobin (Hb) fragments - hemocidins. However, to date, the genesis of such peptides is unclear. The presented study demonstrates that the action of C. albicans isozymes Sap1-Sap6, Sap8 and Sap9, but not Sap7 and Sap10, toward human hemoglobin leads to limited proteolysis of this protein and generates a variety of antimicrobial hemocidins. We have identified these peptides and checked their activity against selected microorganisms representative for human vagina. We have also demonstrated that the process of Hb hydrolysis is most effective at pH 4.0, characteristic for vagina, and the liberated peptides showed pronounced killing activity toward Lactobacillus acidophilus, and to a lower degree, Escherichia coli. However, only a very weak activity toward Staphylococcus aureus and C. albicans was noticed. These findings provide interesting new insights into pathophysiology of human vaginal candidiasis and suggest that C. albicans may be able to compete with the other microorganisms of the same physiological niche using the microbicidal peptides generated from the host protein.")

('>F', 'TI  - Impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.', 'AB  - Male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. This is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. In mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. In male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. The sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. In this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. Six different intestinal bacteria, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium bifermentans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. For each bacterium, 50 microL of semen was diluted in 450 microL of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. The experiment was repeated twice. In each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. Also, the pH was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. The results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001), but broths containing Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. Although broth containing Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. Broths containing E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. However, pH was increased when semen was exposed to the E. coli and Campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus treatments, pH was reduced. In conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.')

Previous observations have shown that CNTs have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of CNTs to human gut microbes has not been investigated. Here, the antibacterial activity of CNTs against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--L. acidophilus, B. adolescentis, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus--are evaluated. The bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. In this study, CNTs, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled CNTs (s-MWCNTs: 0.5-2 mum; l-MWCNTs: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. Notably, CNTs may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of CNTs, but also the shapes of the bacteria. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components DNA and RNA and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. Thin and rigid SWCNT show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than MWCNTs. Long MWCNT may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. This work suggests that CNTs may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of CNTs could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.')

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability to inhibit catalase of the test strains used and to reduce bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical were determined in corynebacteria. H2O2 containing metabolites were obtained by cultivating lactobacilli in mineral medium, the amount of H2O2 was determined by oxidation of TMB by peroxidase. Bactericidal effect of lactobacilli metabolites for test strains treated by corynebacteria metabolites was evaluated by seeding results. Results. Inhibitio by corynebacteria metabolites of S. aureus catalase activity by 30-40% and E. coli catalase activ ity by 40-70% was shown. A reduction of bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radicals by corynebacteria metabolites by 30-35% for S. aureus, 38-42% for E. coli and 70-73% for L. acidophilus was noted. The enchantment of bactericidal effect of lactobacilli after treatment of the test strain by corynebacteria metabolites against S. aureus and E. coli manifested by reduction of the numbe of viable cells by 2-3 lg CFU. For L. acidophilus the bactericidal effect oflactobacilli metabolite in the same conditions reduced, and that led to the increase ofviability by 2-4 lg PFU.

Cattle projected to be on a finishing diet during the summer were randomly allocated into 40 study pens within ten blocks based on allocation dates. Blocks were complete; each of the four pens within a block was randomly assigned one treatment: control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM. The DFM was fed (10(6)CFU/animal/day of Lactobacillus) throughout the study periods (84-88 days) and cattle were vaccinated at enrollment and again three weeks later. Fresh fecal samples (30/pen) from pen floors were collected weekly for four consecutive weeks (study days 52-77). Two concurrent culture procedures were used to enable estimates of E. coli O157:H7 shedding prevalence and prevalence of high shedders. From 4800 total samples, 1522 (31.7%) were positive for E. coli O157:H7 and 169 (3.5%) were considered high shedders. Pen-level linear mixed models were used for data analyses. There were no significant interactions among treatments and time of sampling. However, vaccinated pens had lower (P<0.01) overall prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (model-adjusted mean +/- SEM=17.4 +/- 3.95%) and lower (P<0.01) prevalence of high shedders (0.95 +/- 0.26%) than unvaccinated pens (37.0 +/- 6.32% and 4.19 +/- 0.81%, respectively). There was no evidence of a DFM effect on either measure of E. coli O157:H7 shedding. Results indicate that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine significantly reduces fecal prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (vaccine efficacy of 53.0%) and prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 high shedders (vaccine efficacy of 77.3%) in commercial feedlot cattle reared in the summer on a finishing diet with 25% distiller's grains.")

C57Bl/6 mice were fed low- or high-fat diets (10% or 60% kcal from fat) for 10 weeks and tested for anti-bacterial IgG, bodyweight, fasting glucose, and inflammation. Obese diabetic patients had significantly more IgG against extracts of E. coli LF-82 compared with lean controls, whereas IgG against extracts of the other bacteria was unchanged. Circulating TNFalpha was elevated and correlated with IgG against the LF-82 extract. Mice fed high-fat diets had increased fasting glucose levels, elevated TNFalpha and neutrophils, and significantly more IgG against the LF-82 extracts. Diabetes in obesity is characterized by increased IgG against specific bacterial antigens. Specific commensal bacteria may mediate inflammatory effects of high-fat diets.')

We tested D-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. The activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. When ingested together with sucrose or starch, D-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. D-Fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (P < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (Tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. Moreover, D-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) populations (P < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on Bifidobacterium spp. or Lactobacillus spp. At the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of Enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. D-Fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. Based on all this evidence, D-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.')

Nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to HIV-1 infection under natural conditions. If similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against HIV-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. We reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to HIV-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and commensal bacteria on HIV-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. We established the HIV-1 reporter monocytic cell line, THP-1/NL4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. In these cells, stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 by their ligands suppressed HIV-1 expression partly through type I interferon (IFN). Among the commensal bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Veillonella parvula and Neisseria mucosa suppressed HIV-1 expression, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella melaninogenica, P. bivia and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. The bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated TLR4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated TLR2. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 and IFN-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated HIV-1 suppression. Suppressive effects of E. coli, V. parvula and N. mucosa on HIV-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute HIV-1 infection. These findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating TLR4 potentially produce local environments resistant to HIV-1 infection.')

Clove essential oil showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by rosemary and lavender. In an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of these essential oils as food preservatives, they were also tested on an extract made of fish, where clove and thyme essential oils were the most effective. Then, gelatin-chitosan-based edible films incorporated with clove essential oil were elaborated and their antimicrobial activity tested against six selected microorganisms: Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrefaciens, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The clove-containing films inhibited all these microorganisms irrespectively of the film matrix or type of microorganism. In a further experiment, when the complex gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil was applied to fish during chilled storage, the growth of microorganisms was drastically reduced in gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteria, while lactic acid bacteria remained practically constant for much of the storage period. The effect on the microorganisms during this period was in accordance with biochemical indexes of quality, indicating the viability of these films for fish preservation.')

METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis.

Strains of E. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. One particular isolate, named E. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and Shiga toxin levels in coculture of several STEC strains regardless of serovar or Shiga toxin type. The probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced Shiga toxin levels in STEC cultures to an extent similar to E. coli 1307, but commensal E. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. Escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria.

Bacterial maturation of DC occurred independently of tissue origin. Expression of CCR7 and CD103 on the surface of MLN DC, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory T cells, increased with stimulation by Gram-positive commensals. Bacteria-dependent cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) was similar in spleen and MLN DC, and contaminant cells in these DC preparations produced IFN-gamma in response to L. acidophilus. In contrast, PP DC produced IL-6 only in response to E. coli, little IL-10 and no TNF-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by IL-10 or TGF-beta. Bifidobacteria downregulate IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-12 production induced in in vitro-generated DC by L. acidophilus. Similar inhibition was observed in splenic DC, but not in MLN DC. MLN cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher IFN-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. Commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.")

Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions.

METHODS: The activity of a culture of L. acidophilus LB or of the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering Afa/Dr Escherichia coli C1845 bacteria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. RESULTS: Infection of the cells with C1845 bacteria that were treated with L. acidophilus LB culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated C1845 bacteria. The clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus its culture medium antagonizes the C1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.')

By contrast, CD86 expression was significantly increased after stimulation with Lactobacillus (p=0.049) and distinctly increased with E. coli in both groups (p=0.001). The cytokine patterns of CD69-positive T-lymphocytes from allergic patients showed a TH2-dominated response after allergen stimulation (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratio 0.2), directed into a T-helper1-like response by stimulation with both types of bacteria (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratios 1.5-2.0 in both groups). These data show that both types of bacteria modulate the allergic immune response by the alteration of CD23 and co-stimulatory molecule expression. Regarding cytokine production, the data suggest a differential response to both bacteria depending on the atopic state, but a clear promotion of T-helper1-dominated response in allergic donors.')

CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.')

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding ELISA assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of L. acidophilus A4 and 30SC (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. In particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of E. coli O157:H7, under the presence of the cell lysates of L. acidophilus A4, was observed by killing assay of Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, L. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of Stx-2 produced from E. coli O157:H7. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The cell lysates of L. acidophilus can be applied to a variety of foods, and can be used as adjuncts for the inhibition of Stx-2-mediated cytotoxicity.')

In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.')

('>F', 'TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.', 'AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.')

METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.')

Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of Clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. These two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk.

They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.')

Biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. Surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. The bacteria used were; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus B-13. Initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. The adhesion behaviour of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. However, the percentage of attached E. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while L. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour.

RESULTS: The activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB isolated from the resident human gastrointestinal microflora was examined. A dose dependent decrease in viability of C1845 bacteria was observed after both direct contact in vitro between the spent culture supernatant (LB-SCS) and the bacteria, and when the bacteria were adherent on Caco-2/TC7 cells. Protection against the C1845 induced alterations in expression of F-actin, sucrase-isomaltase, dipeptidylpeptidase IV, alkaline phosphatase, and fructose transporter alterations was observed when the cells were exposed to LB-SCS.

The activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. Two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against Escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid.

N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16).

All possible di- and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed before experimental oral infection with Sfr. The data showed that antagonism was obtained only when E. coli EMO was present.

The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR.

We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria.

Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.

Both types of fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. With two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype O75:K5:H-, the P-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; P < 0.0001). The expression of P fimbriae by 824 was also retained during colonization. With transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of P fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. When the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. In contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant E. coli strains colonized in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus sp. The results indicate that P fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota.

When L. acidophilus was employed, the addition of H(2)O(2) was not required; however, the protective effect of catalase suggested that, in this instance, H(2)O(2) was generated by the organisms. The antibacterial effect was largely prevented by preheating the myeloperoxidase at 80 C or greater for 10 min or by the addition of a number of inhibitors; it was most active at the most acid pH employed (5.0). Lactoperoxidase was considerably less effective than was myeloperoxidase when chloride was the halide employed. Myeloperoxidase, at high concentrations, exerted an antibacterial effect on L. acidophilus in the absence of added halide, which also was temperature- and catalase-sensitive. Peroxidase was extracted from intact guinea pig leukocytes by weak acid, and the extract with peroxidase activity had antibacterial properties which were similar, in many respects, to those of the purified preparation of myeloperoxidase. Under appropriate conditions, the antibacterial effect was increased by halides and by H(2)O(2) and was decreased by catalase, as well as by cyanide, azide, Tapazole, and thiosulfate. This suggests that, under the conditions employed, the antibacterial properties of a weak acid extract of guinea pig leukocytes is due, in part, to its peroxidase content, particularly if a halide is present in the reaction mixture.

Experiments using an Escherichia coli strain susceptible to all antimicrobials were also conducted. C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or Lactobacillus plantarum. Survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. Experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium lactis; LactoLevure((R))). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed P. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. Pre-treatment with L. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either MDR P. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%; P=0.026) or E. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, P=0.003). Survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with LactoLevure((R)). Tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. TNFalpha and IL-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and IFNgamma production was decreased. Pre-treatment with LactoLevure((R)) restored production of IL-17.

Probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. AIMS: To identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (In-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of Lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. To compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in Baghdad during August to November 2009. These swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. Subcultures were performed on selective media. The necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. Susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates Lacto. Acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/mL) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Ninety different organisms were isolated. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). However, the incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic Streptococci was 4(4.4%). In susceptibility testing, Lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. The coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. CONCLUSION: The results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/mL had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections.

Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced.

During their transit through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract, STEC encounters a number of acidic environments. As all STEC strains are not equally resistant to acidic conditions, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether acid resistance confers an ecological advantage to STEC strains in ruminant digestive contents and whether acid resistance mechanisms are induced in the rumen compartment. We found that acid-resistant STEC survived at higher rates during prolonged incubation in rumen fluid than acid-sensitive STEC and that they resisted the highly acidic conditions of the abomasum fluid, whereas acid-sensitive strains were killed. However, transit through the rumen contents allowed acid-sensitive strains to survive in the abomasum fluid at levels similar to those of acid-resistant STEC. The acid resistance status of the strains had little influence on STEC growth in jejunal and cecal contents. Supplementation with the probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 or Lactobacillus acidophilus BT-1386 led to killing of all of the strains tested during prolonged incubation in the rumen contents, but it did not have any influence in the other digestive compartments. In addition, S. cerevisiae did not limit the induction of acid resistance in the rumen fluid. Our results indicate that the rumen compartment could be a relevant target for intervention strategies that could both limit STEC survival and eliminate induction of acid resistance mechanisms in order to decrease the number of viable STEC cells reaching the hindgut and thus STEC shedding and food contamination.')

The survival of E. sakazakii populations in reconstituted infant formula containing a sodium caseinate fermentate was compared with survival in formula containing positive (monocaprylin) and negative controls. The L. acidophilus DPC 6026 sodium caseinate fermentate reduced pathogen numbers by >4 log CFU/ml at 37 degrees C, comparing favorably with the activity of monocaprylin. Additionally, E. sakazakii NCTC 8155 was inoculated into pasteurized, reconstituted infant formula (6 log CFUlml) followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of the fermentate (0.21 to 6.7% [wt/vol]). At a concentration of 0.21% (wt/vol), pathogen viability was maintained over 4 h at 6.0 log CFU/ml. In contrast, pathogen numbers increased approximately 100-fold in the control formula in the same time frame. At higher final fermentate concentrations (-3.33% [wt/vol]), numbers were reduced to 0 log CFU/ml over 60 min. The spectrum of activity of the fermentate against other foodborne pathogens was also determined and shown to be effective against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria innocua.

It has been shown to be effective against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 infection. We have previously shown that molecules released by probiotic strain La-5 influence the transcription of EHEC genes involved in colonization and quorum sensing. In this work, we report on the ability of these molecules to prevent the adherence of EHEC to epithelial cells and on its capacity to concentrate F-actin at adhesion sites. With a fluorescein-labeled phallotoxin, it was shown that La-5 cell-free spent medium (CFSM) fractions remarkably reduced attaching and effacing lesions in HeLa cells. We also observed a significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion to Hep-2 cells when they were treated with the same La-5 CFSM fractions. In order to observe if La-5 CFSM fractions exhibited the same effect in vivo, we studied the ability of luminescent EHEC constructs (LEE1::luxCDABE) to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells of specific-pathogen-free ICR mice following intragastric inoculation. Colonization of the GI tract by luminescent EHEC O157:H7 was monitored in real time with a slow-scan charge-coupled device camera. At the same time, fecal shedding of EHEC was studied. Following oral gavage of the La-5 active fraction, we observed a reduced amount of bioluminescence signal along with a decrease in fecal shedding by mice, indicating an effect on the ability of the organism to colonize the GI tract.

One of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system.

Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: Probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas and Escherichia coli in the colonic tissue.

Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus.

Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.')

Five hundred yearling steers were housed in pens of 10 animals each. At arrival, steers were randomly allocated to one of five cohorts. Four of the cohorts were fed various strains and dosages of Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials throughout the feeding period. Fecal samples were collected from the rectum of each animal immediately prior to shipment to the abattoir. E. coli O157 was detected using selective enrichment and immunomagnetic separation techniques. For positive samples, E. coli O157 concentration was estimated using a most-probable-number (MPN) technique that included immunomagnetic separation. Prevalence varied among the cohorts (P < 0.01). The prevalence in the controls (26.3%) was greater (P < 0.05) than that in cattle supplemented with L. acidophilus strains NP51, NP28, or NP51-NP35 (13.0, 11.0, and 11.0%, respectively). The greatest E. coli O157 concentration was also observed in the controls (3.2 log MPN/g of feces); this concentration was greater (P < 0.05) than that observed in positive animals receiving NP51, NP28, or NP51-NP35 (0.9, 1.1, 1.7 log MPN/g of feces, respectively). Specific strains of Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials effectively reduced the prevalence and concentration of E. coli O157 in harvest-ready cattle, whereas others did not. When using direct-fed microbials to reduce carriage of E. coli O157 in cattle, it is important to select appropriately validated products.')

('>T', 'TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 on Escherichia coil O157:H7 fecal shedding and finishing performance in beef feedlot cattle.', 'AB  - A 2-year study was conducted during the summer months (May to September) to test  the effectiveness of feeding Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 on the proportion of cattle shedding Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the feces and evaluate the effect of the treatment on finishing performance. Steers (n = 448) were assigned randomly to pens, and pens of cattle were assigned randomly to NP51 supplementation or no supplementation (control). NP51 products were mixed with water and applied as the feed was mixed daily in treatment-designated trucks at the rate of 10(9) CFU per steer. Fecal samples were collected (n = 3,360) from the rectum from each animal every 3 weeks, and E. coli O157:H7 was isolated by standard procedures, using selective enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, and PCR confirmation. The outcome variable was the recovery of E. coli O157:H7 from feces, and was modeled using logistic regression accounting for year, repeated measures of pens of cattle, and block. No significant differences were detected for gain, intakes, or feed efficiency of control or NP51-fed steers. The probability for cattle to shed E. coli O157:H7 varied significantly between 2002 and 2003 (P = 0.004). In 2002 and 2003, the probability for NP51-treated steers to shed E. coli O157:H7 over the test periods was 13 and 21%, respectively, compared with 21 and 28% among controls. Over the 2 years, NP51-treated steers were 35% less likely to shed E. coli O157: H7 than were steers in untreated pens (odds ratio = 0.58, P = 0.008). This study is consistent with previous reports that feeding NP51 is effective in reducing E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding in feedlot cattle.')

('>T', 'TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.', 'AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens.

Lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens). Examined supernatants from Lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against C. perfringens. Lower antimicrobial activity were observed against E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis. The strongest inhibition effect were obtained using supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3D.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell-free preparations, pH neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. The bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. The cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log CFU ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic pH. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. L. mucosae, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (Degree of Polymerization (DP) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. This effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. This inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic pH.

Fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for E. coli O157:H7 were collected. LAB were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deMan Rogosa Sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. Six hundred eighty-six pure colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7. Three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. Seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. Most isolates were tolerant of acid at pH levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the API system.

Since sCD14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether sCD14 could mediate their effects on human IECs. To this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the IECs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of sCD14. In contrast to LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria Lactobacillus johnsonii strain La1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La10 nor their LTAs stimulated IECs, even in the presence of sCD14. However, both LTAs inhibited the sCD14-mediated LPS responsiveness of IECs. We have previously hypothesized that sCD14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from IECs. The present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their LTAs, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.')
