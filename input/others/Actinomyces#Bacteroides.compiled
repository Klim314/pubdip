TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - Specific character of anaerobic bacterial infections in patients treated in transplantation wards at one of the clinical hospitals in Warsaw.
AB  - Immunocompromised patients and patients undergoing invasive procedures are predisposed to bacterial infections, due to the possibility of micro-organism translocation from their physiological habitat. Infectious complications may occur both in the early and late post-transplantation periods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion as well as susceptibility profiles of obligatory anaerobes in the etiology of infections in patients hospitalized at transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital in Warsaw. A total of 104 strains of obligatory anaerobes derived from patients hospitalized in two transplantation clinics at a clinical hospital in Warsaw were evaluated. The strains were isolated from 87 clinical samples collected from 84 patients of two transplantation wards between 2007 and 2012. A total of 104 obligatory anaerobic bacterial strains were isolated and identified, with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria constituting 60.6% and 39.4% of the isolates, respectively. Almost exclusively non-spore-forming anaerobes were detected in evaluated samples. The present study showed all isolated Gram-positive bacteria to be susceptible to ss-lactam antibiotics. Metronidazole-resistant bacteria were found among the genera Propionibacterium and Actinomyces. All Gram-negative rods were susceptible to imipenem and metronidazole. Among them, Bacteroides spp. and Parabacteroides distasonis showed resistance to penicillin G (100%). Because of their pathogenicity and altered antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the bacteria of the genera Bacteroides and Parabacteroides are of greatest clinical importance. Approximately 25% of isolates exhibit also resistance to clindamycin. Because of the growing rates of clindamycin resistance, the role of metronidazole in the treatment of Bacteroides spp. is of increasing importance.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria in Ontario, 2010-2011.
AB  - The local epidemiology of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in anaerobic bacteria is important in guiding the empiric treatment of infections. However, susceptibility data are very limited on anaerobic organisms, particularly among non-Bacteroides organisms. To determine susceptibility profiles of clinically-significant anaerobic bacteria in Ontario Canada, anaerobic isolates from sterile sites submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratory (PHOL) for identification and susceptibility testing were included in this study. Using the E-test method, isolates were tested for various antimicrobials including, penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole. The MIC results were interpreted based on guidelines published by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Of 2527 anaerobic isolates submitted to PHOL, 1412 were either from sterile sites or bronchial lavage, and underwent susceptibility testing. Among Bacteroides fragilis, 98.2%, 24.7%, 1.6%, and 1.2% were resistant to penicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole, respectively. Clostridium perfringens was universally susceptible to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, whereas 14.2% of other Clostridium spp. were resistant to penicillin. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Actinomyces spp., Parvimonas micra and Propionibacterium spp. were universally susceptible to beta-lactams. Eggerthella spp., Collinsella spp., and Eubacterium spp. showed variable resistance to penicillin. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., and Veillonella spp. showed high resistance to penicillin but were universally susceptible to meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. The detection of metronidazole resistant B. fragilis is concerning as occurrence of these isolates is extremely rare. These data highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to provide clinically relevant information to clinicians for empiric management of infections caused by anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  - The currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. We explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative classification of periodontitis. We used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis, with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum IgG antibodies to periodontal microbiota. Adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. Differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. Patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). Patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. The findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.
TI  - The effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. All patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. RESULTS: Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum, while Campylobacter rectus, Parvimonas micra, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.
TI  - Microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. However, recently, salivary analysis has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: Whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with CP and 33 patients with AgP. Twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16S ribosomal RNA-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. RESULTS: All bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. For Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, as well as Actinomyces viscosus, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Eubacterium nodatum, and Campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types of periodontitis. There were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between AgP and CP. CONCLUSION: Salivary analysis might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for microbiologic analysis in both AgP and CP.
TI  - Immunological and microbiological findings after the application of two periodontal surgical techniques: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: To examine microbiological and immunological alterations following two periodontal surgical techniques, over a 6-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 chronic periodontitis patients participated in the present randomized controlled clinical trial and were randomized in two groups. Modified Widman flap (MWF) was applied in the control group and apically positioned flap (APF), without intervention to the bone, in the experimental group. Gingival crevicular fluid samples and subgingival plaque samples from the operated sites were collected at baseline, 6th, 12th and 24th post-operative week. RESULTS: No major differences were noticed in immunological and microbiological profile of patients receiving either modified MWF or APF, for a period of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of the periodontal surgical procedure does not seem to affect the immunological and the microbiological profile of patients with chronic periodontitis.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Multi-centre evaluation of mass spectrometric identification of anaerobic bacteria using the VITEK(R) MS system.
AB  - Accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. Classic phenotypic methods for identification require long turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification of anaerobes. We present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance of the VITEK((R)) MS in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. Five different test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. Multiple species were included for several of the genera. Briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. Matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. Mass spectra results were generated with the VITEK((R)) MS, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the VITEK((R)) MS database 2.0. Results were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. An additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. Genus-level identification consisted of Actinomyces, Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces neuii and Bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other anaerobes tested. VITEK((R)) MS identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.
TI  - Pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. Lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. AIM: Considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on BD Columbia Agar with 5% sheep blood. Incubation was done in anaerobe condition using GENbag system produced by BioMerieux Company. RESULTS: The microorganisms that we determined were Streptococcus mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, Gram-negative bacilli (Bacteroides ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron) and Gram-positive bacilli (Bifidobacterium spp., Actinomyces israelii, Clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. These bacteria can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus Ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (Ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. STUDY DESIGN: An in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials, using a disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. Modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited resistance; on the other hand, Ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). Clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to Ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.
TI  - Subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. However, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of DM on periodontal subgingival microbiota. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. Subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing technique. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of TM7, Aggregatibacter, Neisseria, Gemella, Eikenella, Selenomonas, Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of Porphyromonas, Filifactor, Eubacterium, Synergistetes, Tannerella and Treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). Moreover, some phylotypes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella parvula, V. dispar and Eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.
TI  - Levels of Selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P. gingivalis and S. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. sputigena and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated further.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Oral microbiota in Swiss adolescents.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a Swiss adolescent population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. Plaque index, bleeding on probing (BOP), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (DMFT) index were recorded. Samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Additionally, counts of Streptococus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Periodontitis was not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival inflammation displaying a mean BOP of 28%. Ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for P. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia, (47.5%) for T. denticola. T. denticola and S. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas T. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. DMFT was associated with S. mutans counts, and BOP correlated with counts of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among Swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in Swiss adolescents with gingivitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although gingivitis was a frequent finding in Swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. The dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Persistent extraradicular infection in root-filled asymptomatic human tooth: scanning electron microscopic analysis and microbial investigation after apical microsurgery.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Procedural accidents have a negative effect on healing and might contribute to the persistence of infections in inaccessible apical areas, requiring surgical intervention. This report describes a case of persistent apical periodontitis of a lower left first molar associated with the sinus tract and a periapical lesion that required nonsurgical endodontic retreatment and apical surgery for resolution. METHODS: The tooth had received endodontic treatment 3 years ago and had to be retreated using the crown-down technique with chemical auxiliary substance (2% chlorhexidine gel), foramen patency, and enlargement and was filled in a single appointment. The occlusal access cavity was immediately restored with composite resin. After 1 month, it could be observed that the sinus tract persisted and, radiographically, the lesion remained unaltered. Therefore, endodontic microsurgery was indicated. Apical microsurgery was performed under magnification with the use of a dental operating microscope including apicectomy, root end with ultrasound, and sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. A microbiological sample was collected from the apical lesion. The resected distal root apex was observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The following species were detected: Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces meyeri, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium botullinum, Parvimonas micra, and Bacteroides ureolyticus; scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed bacterial biofilm surrounding the apical foramen and external radicular surface. Gutta-percha overfilling at the apex because of a zip caused during initial endodontic treatment could be observed. A 6-month follow-up showed apparent radiographic periapical healing, which progressed after 24 months. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and extraradicular biofilm seem to participate in the maintenance of persistent periapical pathology, and endodontic retreatment followed by periapical microsurgery proved to be a successful alternative in the resolution of persistent extraradicular infections.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria colonizing the lower airways in lung cancer patients.
AB  - Anaerobes comprise most of the endogenous oropharyngeal microflora, and can cause infections of airways in lung cancer patients who are at high risk for respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and species diversity of anaerobes in specimens from the lower airways of lung cancer patients. Sensitivity of the isolates to conventional antimicrobial agents used in anaerobe therapy was assessed. Respiratory secretions obtained by bronchoscopy from 30 lung cancer patients were cultured onto Wilkins-Chalgren agar in anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for 72-96 hours. The isolates were identified using microtest Api 20A. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for penicillin G, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, and metronidazole were determined by E-test. A total of 47 isolates of anaerobic bacteria were detected in 22 (73.3%) specimens. More than one species of anaerobe was found in 16 (53.3%) samples. The most frequently isolated were Actinomyces spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., followed by Eubacterium lentum, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides spp., Lactobacillus jensenii. Among antibiotics used in the study amoxicillin/clavulanate and imipenem were the most active in vitro (0% and 2% resistant strains, respectively). The highest resistance rate was found for penicillin G and metronidazole (36% and 38% resistant strains, respectively). The results obtained confirm the need to conduct analyses of anaerobic microflora colonizing the lower respiratory tract in patients with lung cancer to monitor potential etiologic factors of airways infections, as well as to propose efficient, empirical therapy.
TI  - A pilot study: microbiological conditions of the oral cavity in minipigs for peri-implantitis models.
AB  - As peri-implantitis is an emerging problem, the development of validated animal models is mandatory. The aim of this pilot study was to provide a first step in describing the normal oral flora of minipigs. In five minipigs, samples of the oral flora were collected with sterile cotton swabs from the buccal gingiva of the lower jaw. Two swabs per animal were collected, followed by bacterial isolation under both aerobe and anaerobe conditions. Microbiological analyses included biochemical tests, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 61 taxa were detected, 14-21 different bacterial taxa from each minipig. Among the Gram-positive cocci, mainly staphylococcal and streptococcal species were identified. Different Actinomyces species were the most abundant taxa in the group of Gram-positive rods. Among the anaerobic bacteria, the Gram-negative genera Fusobacterium, Bacteroides and Prevotella were the most often observed taxa. This is the first study which begins to describe the normal oral flora in minipigs in cultures to allow for the detection of a broad spectrum. Several bacterial species identified are different from human ones. No specific species for peri-implantitis could be detected in that healthy sample.
TI  - [Resistance to B-lactamines of bacteria responsible for endodontic root canal infections].
AB  - Samples were taken under strictly anaerobic conditions from the root canals of 22 patients having a tooth in which necrotic pulp was associated with an inflammatory peri-apical lesion an optical periodontitis. In the majority of cases (85%), these lesions were chronic and the pulp chamber was closed. One hundred and two strains were isolated, 71.7% of the bacteria being obligate anaerobes and 49.8% being Gram-negative bacilli. Their ability to produce beta-lactamases was tested and 8.8% gave a positive reaction in a cefinase test. These cefinase positive strains were nevertheless susceptible to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin) and to amoxicillin-clavulanate, with the exception of M. Morganii.
TI  - Gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. We recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at Day 21, Day 25, Day 30 and Day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). RNA was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus2.0 microarrays. Paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. Gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. RESULTS: The median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at Day 21 and 1 at Day 35. Differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. Leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria associated with canine periodontal disease.
AB  - Periodontal disease is one of the most common diseases of adult dogs, with up to  80% of animals affected. The aetiology of the disease is poorly studied, although bacteria are known to play a major role. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria associated with canine gingivitis and periodontitis and to compare this with the normal oral flora. Swabs were obtained from the gingival margin of three dogs with gingivitis and three orally healthy controls, and subgingival plaque was collected from three dogs with periodontitis. Samples were subjected to routine bacterial culture. The prevalent species identified in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups were uncultured bacterium (12.5% of isolates), Bacteroides heparinolyticus/Pasteurella dagmatis (10.0%) and Actinomyces canis (19.4%), respectively. Bacteria were also identified using culture-independent methods (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and the predominant species identified were Pseudomonas sp. (30.9% of clones analysed), Porphyromonas cangingivalis (16.1%) and Desulfomicrobium orale (12.0%) in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. Uncultured species accounted for 13.2%, 2.0% and 10.5%, and potentially novel species for 38.2%, 38.3% and 35.3%, of clones in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. This is the first study to use utilise culture-independent methods for the identification of bacteria associated with this disease. It is concluded that the canine oral flora in health and disease is highly diverse and also contains a high proportion of uncultured and, in particular, potentially novel species.
TI  - Microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - AIM: To monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. Significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. Supragingival counts of Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. Subgingival counts were greater for Actinomyces, green and orange complex species. Significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0 at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked in periodontitis.
TI  - Microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (Er:YAG) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. METHODS: In a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an Er:YAG laser or an air-abrasive device. Routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. Baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (PD) at the implant. Non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. RESULTS: PD reductions (mean +/- SD) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). No baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. In the air-abrasive group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (P <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (P = 0.002), and Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (P = 0.002). Both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. Porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At 1 month, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group, and Fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. Six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. Clinical improvements were limited.
TI  - Effect of non-surgical treatment on chronic and aggressive periodontitis: clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic findings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our goal was to examine differences in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses to non-surgical mechanical therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP) and generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). METHODS: Twenty patients with GCP and 14 patients with GAgP were evaluated. Clinical data, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. GCF interleukin (IL)-1beta, -4, and -8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were analyzed using a multiplexed bead immunoassay, and elastase activity was measured using an enzymatic assay. The significance of changes with time was examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters after therapy were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: After periodontal therapy, we found significant improvements for all clinical parameters in both groups. We also observed significant reductions in elastase activity in shallow and deep sites from the GAgP group and in deep sites from the GCP group. Microbiologic data showed significant reductions in proportions of orange and red complexes and an increase in proportions of Actinomyces species in both clinical groups. When the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses after therapy were compared between groups, only minor differences were found. CONCLUSION: This study fails to show any significant differences between severe forms of GCP and GAgP in response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can integrate into T cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. Reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger HIV reactivation leading to HIV recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active antiretroviral therapies. METHODS: This study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate HIV promoter activation in various cell models of HIV latency. RESULTS: T cells (1G5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of HIV promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. Direct bacterial challenge of the T cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. Challenge of macrophages (BF24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except Streptococcus mutans. Dendritic cells showed increases in HIV reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate HIV from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = T cells. Expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of intraradicular bacterial composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. METHODS: Intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16S ribosomal DNA forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (HhaI and MspI). The terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated DNA sequencer, and the results were filtered using a statistics-based criterion. RESULTS: Totals of 138 (HhaI) and 145 (MspI) unique T-RFs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. Odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated T-RFs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal space. A significantly greater T-RF prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain. CONCLUSION: Overall, no T-RFLP profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.
TI  - Post-tooth extraction sepsis without locoregional infection--a population-based study in Taiwan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of post-tooth extraction sepsis in patients without locoregional infection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We assessed all claim records of the Taiwanese National Health Insurance program in 2005. Admissions for patients aged > or =16 years containing a discharge diagnosis of sepsis, and who received tooth extraction within 14 days before the admission were identified. Patient charts were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of sepsis and rule out other infection sources. The relationship between postextraction sepsis (PES) and clinical parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-three of the 2 223 971 extraction cases met the criteria of PES, an incidence of 1.48 per 100 000, and seven patients (21.2%) died of the disease. Aging significantly increased the risk of PES (P < 0.001). Pre-existing comorbidities were found in 20 of the 33 cases, with diabetes mellitus and hematologic diseases the most common. The method, number, and position of extraction had no influence on PES incidence. Blood cultures were positive in 25 patients (75.8%) and isolates included species of the Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Enterococcus genera. CONCLUSION: Tooth extraction is associated with a low but significant risk of postoperative sepsis, especially in the elderly and patients with underlying diseases.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. We investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. METHODS: We used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum IgG levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1988 and 1994. Three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. Optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. Titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. RESULTS: In unadjusted models, high titers to Porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; P <0.05). In parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high P. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high Eubacterium nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IgG titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. The external validity of these findings must be examined further.
TI  - Similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. METHODS: Subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (PD) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. Subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966 subgingival sites). Subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method identifying 37 species. RESULTS: Probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and 16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (P = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (P = 0.78). With the exceptions of Campylobacter gracilis (P <0.001) and Actinomyces naeslundii (P <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. A trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for Prevotella nigrescens (P <0.01). At a cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. This may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.
TI  - Granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. The chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (CXCL6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. Previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. Nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. In this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 arrays. The expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridizations. RESULTS: Among all known chemokines, GCP-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mRNA (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). Increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth, but not with attachment loss. Immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. CONCLUSION: The level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.
TI  - Composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm of subjects with healthy and diseased implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the microbial composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm in subjects with and without peri-implantitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-four subjects (mean age 48.9 +/- 13.51 years) with at least one implant restored and functional for at least 2 years were assigned to two groups: a peri-implantitis group (n=22), consisting of subjects presenting peri-implant sites with radiographic defects >3 mm, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration; and a control group (n=22), consisting of subjects with healthy implants. The clinical parameters evaluated were plaque index, gingival bleeding, bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing depth and clinical attachment level. Supra- and subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of each implant and analyzed for the presence of 36 microorganisms by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia were observed in the peri-implantitis group, both supra- and subgingivally (P<0.05). The proportions of the pathogens from the red complex were elevated, while host-compatible beneficial microbial complexes were reduced in diseased compared with healthy implants. The microbiological profiles of supra- and subgingival environments did not differ substantially within each group. CONCLUSION: Marked differences were observed in the composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. The microbiota associated with peri-implantitis was comprised of more periodontal pathogenic bacterial species, including the supragingival biofilm.
TI  - Distribution of secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein among anaerobic bacteria isolated from stool of children with diarrhea.
AB  - AIM: To study the secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein (SIPMP) phenotypes of faecal anaerobic isolates from patients with diarrhea. METHODS: Faecal isolates of anaerobic bacteria (B. fragilis, n = 42; B. longum, n = 70; A. israelii, n = 21; E. lentum, n = 12) from children with diarrhea were tested. SIPMP production was tested by inhibition of platelet microbicidal protein (PMP) bioactivity against B. subtilis and was expressed as percentage of inhibition of PMP bactericidal activity. RESULTS: Among anaerobic isolates 80% of B. longum strains, 85.7% of A. israelii strains, 50% of E. lentum strains and 92.86% of B. fragilis strains were SIPMP-positive. The isolated anaerobic organisms demonstrated SIPMP production at a mean level of 13.8% +/- 0.7%, 14.7% +/- 1.8%, 3.9% +/- 0.9% (P < 0.05) and 26.8% +/- 7.5% (P < 0.05) for bifidobacteria, A. israelii, E. lentum and B. fragilis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Data from the present study may have significant implications in understanding the pathogenesis of microecological disorders in the intestine, as well as for future improvement in the prevention and therapy of anaerobe-associated infections.
TI  - Rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by MALDI-TOF-MS.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. All the references and 10 clinical isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. All the strains were then analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. RESULTS: The reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic MALDI-TOF-MS spectra with peaks between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. On visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. Obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. The reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. The spectra of the Prevotella intermedia strains identified with MALDI clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of Prevotella nigrescens, proving that MALDI-TOF-MS is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. The quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (Mathworks:/Matlab Reference Manual v2007a/, Statistical toolbox). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MALDI-TOF-MS might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. It may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.
TI  - Pericarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of pericarditis  due to anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes isolated from patients with pericarditis are Gram-negative bacilli (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group) as well as Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces spp. Anaerobic bacteria can be recovered from pericarditis resulting from the following mechanisms: (i) spread from a contiguous site of infection, either de novo or following surgery or trauma (pleuropulmonary, oesophageal fistula or perforation, and odontogenic); (ii) spread from a site of infection within the heart, most commonly from endocarditis; (iii) haematogenous infection; and (iv) direct inoculation resulting from a penetrating injury or cardiothoracic surgery. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli have increased their resistance to penicillins and other antimicrobial agents in the last two decades. Identification of pathogens and determination of their antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production are essential for adequate selection of antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms.
TI  - Influence of local tetracycline on the microbiota of alveolar osteitis in rats.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of local tetracycline on the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in rats, and on the microbiota associated to this infection. Forty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10): I - the rats had the maxillary right incisor extracted and the alveolar wound did not receive any treatment; II - adrenaline and Ringer-PRAS were introduced into the alveolar wound; III - the alveolar wound was irrigated with sterile saline; and IV - the alveolar wound was irrigated with an aqueous solution of tetracycline. Microbial samples from the alveolar wounds were collected 2 days after surgery and inoculated on blood agar (with and without 8 microg/mL of tetracycline) and other selective media, and were incubated in either aerobiosis or anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C, for 2 to 14 days. It was verified that tetracycline reduced the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in the rats and caused significant changes in the microbiota of the surgical sites, decreasing the number of anaerobes and increasing the participation of tetracycline-resistant and multi-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. METHODS: Fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. Microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using 34 genomic DNA probes. The results were analyzed statistically by Mann-Whitney U-test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) Campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) Gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) Streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) Capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) Treponema denticola (58%); and (6) Streptococcus intermedius (49%). The most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1) C. rectus (90%); (2) T. denticola (88%); (3) S. intermedius (77%); (4) G. morbilorum (73%); (5) Streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) C. ochracea (63%); (7) S. gordonii (55%); (8) Streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) Leptotrichia buccalis (51%). Except for Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (P<.05). Groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (P<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. A large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
TI  - Predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  - We isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with Porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. As predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, Collinsella-reltaed strains, Eubacterium-reltaed strains, Streptococcus suis-related strains, and Veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. In addition, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, and P. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. The results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Isolation of obligate anaerobic bacteria from ulcerative keratitis in domestic animals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of obligate anaerobic bacterial isolation from corneal samples of domestic animals with ulcerative keratitis and to characterize the historical, clinical, cytological, and microbiological features of culture-positive cases. ANIMALS STUDIED: Three hundred and thirty domestic animals with ulcerative keratitis. PROCEDURES: Anaerobic bacteriologic culture and Gram stain were performed on corneal samples from consecutive animals examined with suspect septic ulcerative keratitis. Additional corneal diagnostics included: aerobic bacteriologic culture for all species; fungal culture for ungulates; Mycoplasma culture and virus isolation or feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cats. Historical, clinical, and cytological findings were correlated with microbiologic data. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 13.0% of corneal samples (dogs: 14.0%; horses: 12.9%; cats: 7.9%; alpacas: 18.8%). The most frequent isolates were Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides species. The majority of these infections were mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, unless antimicrobial therapy had been administered prior to presentation. The clinical appearance of anaerobic bacterial culture-positive cases was highly variable. Ocular trauma, pre-existing corneal disease, previous corneal surgery, and chronic dermatological disease were significantly (P < or = 0.05) correlated with positive anaerobic cultures in one or more species. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that obligate anaerobic bacteria are present within the intralesional flora of ulcerative keratitis in domestic animals. In most species evaluated, these bacteria were identified infrequently. Anaerobic bacterial infection of the cornea most frequently occurs in association with other ocular pathogens and previous corneal abnormalities.
TI  - [Psoas abscess of the adult: study of 38 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years (January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes: 16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28 cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31 patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause, with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very variable.
TI  - Susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty strains of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-3. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. Although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to LL-37 than the others (p=0.004). The susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on the species but not on the strains. The periodontopathic bacteria, especially Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003). In addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Actinomycotic bacteraemia after dental procedures.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess role of oral flora in causing bacteraemia following dental manipulations. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing dental manipulations were assessed to study the incidence and nature of bacteraemia following dental procedures with special emphasis on Actinomyces. RESULTS: Incidence of bacteraemia was seen to be 80% of which Actinomycotic bacteraemia was found to be 30 %. Common species of Actinomyces isolated were A. viscosus (58.33 %), A. odontolyticus (8.33 %) and A. naeslundi (8.33 %). Aerobic bacteraemia was seen in 48% patients. Common aerobes isolated from bacteraemia following dental procedures were alpha haemolytic streptococci (25.93 %) and diphtheroides (20.38 %). Anaerobic bacteraemia was seen in 6% patients. Common Anaerobes isolated were Peptostreptococcus spp (33.32 %), Prevotella spp. (16.66%) and Bacteroides spp (16.66%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteraemia was present in 26 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomycotic bacteraemia was more commonly seen in patients with periodontal infections. Thus, prophylactic measures need to be instituted in such patients to prevent cervicofacial, thoracic or abdominal Actinomycosis developing later on.
TI  - Novel rumen bacterial diversity in two geographically separated sub-species of reindeer.
AB  - Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) live under austere nutritional conditions on the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard, while semi-domesticated Norwegian reindeer (R. tarandus tarandus) migrate between lush coastal summer pastures and inland winter pastures with lichens on mainland Norway. Svalbard reindeer are known to have high rumen concentrations of cellulolytic bacteria, ranging from 15% of the viable population in summer to 35% in winter, compared to only 2.5% in Norwegian reindeer. Their rumen bacterial diversity was investigated through comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences ( approximately 1.5 kb in length) generated from clone libraries (n = 121) and bacterial isolates (n = 51). LIBSHUFF comparisons of the composition of the two 16S rRNA libraries from Norwegian reindeer showed a significant effect of artificial feeding compared to natural pasture, but failed to yield significant differences between libraries from Norwegian reindeer and Svalbard reindeer. The combined sequences from reindeer were not significantly different from those reported in wild Thompson's gazelle in Kenya but did differ from those reported in domestic cattle in Japan. A total of 90 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by employing a criterion of 97% similarity, while the Chao1 index estimated the reindeer bacterial rumen population richness at 698 OTUs. The majority of the clone library sequences (92.5%) represented novel strains with <97% identity to any known sequence in the public database, most of them affiliated with the bacterial phylum Firmicutes (low G+C Gram-positives) related to the order Clostridiales (76.7%), while Gram-negative bacteria in the Bacteriodales (Prevotella-Bacteroides group) contributed to 22.5%. Also, six of the isolates were putatively novel strains, possibly representing new species in the Clostridium subphylum (cluster XIVa), Actinomyces and Butyrivibrio.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated Mexican subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Specific microbial profiles that may distinguish between generalized aggressive-periodontitis (GAgP) and generalized chronic-periodontitis (GCP) have, to date, not been described. The purpose of the present study was to describe the subgingival microbial composition of Mexican subjects with GAgP and compare it with that of individuals with GCP and periodontal health (PH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven subjects with GAgP (n=19), GCP (n=39) and PH (n=19) were selected. Clinical measurements included plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Up to 28 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each subject and analysed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: GAgP and GCP subjects harboured significantly higher levels and/or proportion of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (levels: p<0.001, proportion: p<0.01), Prevotella nigrescens (p<0.05 levels) and "red" complex species (p<0.001 proportion) than PH subjects. All GAgP subjects were carriers of P. gingivalis and P. nigrescens. No significant differences in any of the 40 microbial species tested were detected between GAgP and GCP subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the microbial differences between GAgP and GCP subjects were only discrete and none of the bacterial species tested seemed to specifically differentiate the subgingival microbial profile of either periodontitis group.
TI  - In vitro antianaerobic activity of DX-619, a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DX-619, a new des-F(6) quinolone, against anaerobic bacteria was evaluated. DX-619 showed potent activity against Bacteroides, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Micromonas, Actinomyces, and Clostridium spp., with MIC(50)s/MIC(90)s of </=0.03 to 0.25/</=0.03 to 1 microg/ml, respectively. DX-619 was also active against imipenem-resistant Bacteroides spp., with MIC(50)s/MIC(90)s of 0.25/1 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Activity and cellular localization of amylases of rabbit cecal bacteria.
AB  - Five 11-week-old rabbits, fed a commercial granulated feed, were slaughtered and  cecal starch-degrading bacteria enumerated; total concentration of cultivable bacteria utilizing starch averaged 5.5 x 10(10) CFU/g. The activity and cellular localization of amylases was determined in 9 bacteria identified as Actinomyces israeli (strains AA2 and AD4), Bacteroides spp. (strain AA3), Dichelobacter nodosus (strain AA4), Mitsuokella multiacidus (strain AA6), Eubacterium spp. (strains AA7 and AB2), Clostridium spp. (strains AD1 and AA5). Four strains (AA3, AA4, AA5, AD4) produced extracellular amylases with an activity of 26-35 micromol of reducing sugars per h per mg of protein; in five strains (AA2, AA6, AA7, AB2, AD1) amylases were membrane-bound with an activity of 14-18 micromol of reducing sugars per h per mg of protein. All strains exhibited a low intracellular amylolytic activity. The pH optimum of amylases was 6.8-7.0. In strains producing extracellular amylases a substantial loss of viscosity was observed during incubations of cultivation supernatant with starch, similar to viscosity reduction in starch solutions treated with alpha-amylase; this indicates an endo-type (random cleavage) of extracellular amylase reaction in the bacteria under study. No strain possessed glucoamylase activity.
TI  - The place of molecular genetic methods in the diagnostics of human pathogenic anaerobic bacteria. A minireview.
AB  - Anaerobic infections are common and can cause diseases associated with severe morbidity, but are easily overlooked in clinical settings. Both the relatively small number of infections due to exogenous anaerobes and the much larger number of infections involving anaerobic species that are originally members of the normal flora, may lead to a life-threatening situation unless appropriate treatment is instituted. Special laboratory procedures are needed for the isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of this diverse group of bacteria. Since many anaerobes grow more slowly than the facultative or aerobic bacteria, and particularly since clinical specimens yielding anaerobic bacteria commonly contain several organisms and often very complex mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, considerable time may elapse before the laboratory is able to provide a final report. Species definition based on phenotypic features is often time-consuming and is not always easy to carry out. Molecular genetic methods may help in the everyday clinical microbiological practice in laboratories dealing with the diagnostics of anaerobic infections. Methods have been introduced for species diagnostics, such as 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP profile determination, which can help to distinguish species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Actinomyces, etc. that are otherwise difficult to differentiate. The use of DNA-DNA hybridization and the sequencing of special regions of the 16S rRNA have revealed fundamental taxonomic changes among anaerobic bacteria. Some anaerobic bacteria are extremely slow growing or not cultivatable at all. To detect them in special infections involving flora changes due to oral malignancy or periodontitis, for instance, a PCR-based hybridization technique is used. Molecular methods have demonstrated the spread of specific resistance genes among the most important anaerobic bacteria, the members of the Bacteroides genus. Their detection and investigation of the IS elements involved in their expression may facilitate following of the spread of antibiotic resistance among anaerobic bacteria involved in infections and in the normal flora members. Molecular methods (a search for toxin genes and ribotyping) may promote a better understanding of the pathogenic features of some anaerobic infections, such as the nosocomial diarrhoea caused by C. difficile and its spread in the hospital environment and the community. The investigation of toxin production at a molecular level helps in the detection of new toxin types. This mini-review surveys some of the results obtained by our group and others using molecular genetic methods in anaerobic diagnostics.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in 118 patients with deep-space head and neck infections from  the University Hospital of Maxillofacial Surgery, Sofia, Bulgaria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and susceptibility to antibacterial agents of anaerobic strains in 118 patients with head and neck abscesses (31) and cellulitis (87). Odontogenic infection was the most common identified source, occurring in 73 (77.7%) of 94 patients. The incidence of anaerobes in abscesses and cellulitis was 71 and 75.9%, respectively, and that in patients before (31 patients) and after (87) the start of empirical treatment was 80.6 and 72.4%, respectively. The detection rates of anaerobes in patients with odontogenic and other sources of infection were 82.2 and 71.4%, respectively. In total, 174 anaerobic strains were found. The predominant bacteria were Prevotella (49 strains), Fusobacterium species (22), Actinomyces spp. (21), anaerobic cocci (20) and Eubacterium spp. (18). Bacteroides fragilis strains were isolated from 7 (5.9%) specimens. The detection rate of Fusobacterium strains from non-treated patients (32.2%) was higher than that from treated patients (13.8%). Resistance rates to clindamycin and metronidazole of Gram-negative anaerobes were 5.4 and 2.5%, respectively, and those of Gram-positive species were 4.5 and 58.3%, respectively. One Prevotella strain was intermediately susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam. In conclusion, the start of empirical treatment could influence the frequency or rate of isolation of Fusobacterium species. The involvement of the Bacteroides fragilis group in some head and neck infections should be considered.
TI  - Development of bacterial and bifidobacterial communities in feces of newborn babies.
AB  - Microbial 16S rDNA from babies' fecal samples were amplified by PCR, and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning and sequencing. PCR-DGGE profiles were used to follow in time the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. Four healthy babies, one baby who received antibiotics and their parents participated to the present study to determine the extent to which administration of antibiotics can modify the bacterial colonization of neonatal human gut and verify the influence of parental factors on the formation of the fecal bacterial community. In the healthy babies, Escherichia coli or bacteria belonging to Clostridium spp. were the initial colonizers rapidly followed by Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Actinomyces. Bifidobacterium species appeared already after five days in the breast-fed babies while there was a delay in the baby who received a formula based diet during only one day after birth. In each baby two or three bifidobacterial species including B. infantis were found. The observed variations in species were not associated with the feeding changes. The comparison of DGGE profiles of the babies and their parents patterns showed bands with equal migration suggesting a vertical transmission determined by genetic and environmental factors. The brief appearance of pioneer bacteria determined as being E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in the profile from the baby under antibiotic therapy, was succeeded by a small stable community consisting of Ruminococcus species. No Bifidobacterium sequences were detectable in this antibiotic-treated baby in spite of a partly breast-milk diet.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Analysis of the antibacterial activity and plaque control benefit of colgate total dentifrice via clinical evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed, from a combined clinical and molecular biologic perspective, the antibacterial and antiplaque efficacy of Colgate Total dentifrice (CTD). METHODOLOGY: A single-blind crossover study design utilized 11 healthy human subjects. After a one-week washout period, subjects donated dental plaque, received a dental prophylaxis, and subsequently brushed with a test product. Twenty-four hours postbrushing, dental plaque was collected and a clinical plaque score determined. Dental plaque was submitted for Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-time PCR) analysis. The same procedure was repeated in accordance with a crossover design for the use of the second test product. Following a one-week washout, a plaque donation, prophylaxis, and brushing with the test product ensued for each subject. Twenty-four hours post-brushing, the subjects returned for a plaque score and plaque donation. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after brushing, dental plaque coverage increased 17.88% +/- 8.27% with CTD, compared to 30.42% +/- 9.97% with Colgate Cavity Protection (CCP; p = 0.005). Real-time PCR found plaque collected 24 hours after brushing with CTD exhibited, on average, fewer representative periodontal pathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis) and fewer early colonizers (Actinomyces naeslundii) than plaque collected before brushing, whereas CCP showed a moderate effect on oral bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study provides clinical and molecular biological evidence to substantiate the antibacterial and plaque control benefits of Colgate Total, and suggests the value of combining a molecular biological method with clinical research to corroborate clinical benefits.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with suspected anaerobic infections].
AB  - The study involved 394 clinical samples sent to the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of Hacettepe University Adult Hospital between January 1997 and May 2004 for anaerobic cultivation. Since multiple cultures from the same clinical samples of the same patient were excluded, the study was carried on 367 samples. The anaerobic cultures were performed in anaerobic jar using AnaeroGen kits (Oxoid, Basingstoke, U.K.) or GENbox (bioMerieux, Lyon, France). The isolates were identified by both classical methods and "BBL Crystal System" (Becton Dickinson, U.S.A.). While no growth was detected in 120 (32.7%) of the clinical samples studied, in 144 samples (39.2%) only aerobes, in 28 (7.6%) only anaerobes and in 75 (20.5%) of the samples both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated. The number of the anaerobic isolates was 217 from 103 samples with anaerobic growth. Of these 103 samples 15 showed single bacterial growth whereas in 88 samples multiple bacterial isolates were detected. Anaerobic isolates consisted of 92 Gram negative bacilli (Bacteroides spp. 50, Prevotella spp. 14, Porphyromonas spp. 10, Fusobacterium spp. 7, Tisierella spp. 2, unidentified 9), 57 Gram positive bacilli (Clostridium spp.17, Propionibacterium spp. 16, Lactobacillus spp. 8, Actinomyces spp. 5, Eubacterium spp. 2, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 1, Mobiluncus mulieris 1, unidentified nonspore forming rods 7), 61 Gram positive cocci (anaerobic cocci 44, microaerophilic cocci 17), and 7 Gram negative cocci (Veillonella spp.). In conclusion, in the samples studied with prediagnosis of anaerobic infection, Bacteroides spp. (23%) were the most common bacteria followed by anaerobic Gram positive cocci (20.3%) and Clostridium spp (7.8%).
TI  - A case of cutaneous odontogenic sinus.
AB  - Despite the fact that cutaneous sinus tracts of odontogenic origin are well documented, the condition is still commonly misdiagnosed, because chronic periapical periodontitis may be asymptomatic and is rarely open to the skin. A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with the chief complaint of a left cheek skin lesion with mild pain. Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous nodule covered with erythematous skin on her left buccal region. Cultures from the subcutaneous nodule grew Bacteroides species and Peptostreptococcus micros but did not yield acid-fast bacilli, fungi, or Actinomyces. Stains of smeared pus showed a considerable number of Gram-negative rods. The histopathological examination revealed a focal abscess formation in the lower dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Dental evaluation, including an orthopantogram, showed a radiolucent alveolar area at the left lower first molar apex, suggesting a periapical abscess. Antibiotic therapy for three weeks associated with surgical root canal therapy eliminated the subcutaneous nodule. A high degree of suspicion is required to correctly diagnose a lower facial lesion as being of odontogenic origin, and prompt dental evaluation should be considered.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - Prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic uterine bacteria during peripartum period in  normal and dystocia-affected buffaloes.
AB  - Parturition complications predispose establishment of uterine infections, which in turn affect subsequent fertility. The aim of present study was to characterize and compare the type of bacterial flora prevalent within the uterine lumen of dystocia-affected buffaloes and compare them with the normally calving buffaloes. The study was conducted on 40 buffaloes; of which 10 calved normally (Group I) and 30 were treated for dystocia (Group II). Bacteriological examination was performed using uterine swabs, which were collected before delivery, immediately after delivery and day's 24-60 postpartum. A total of 30 uterine swabs from Group I and 79 swabs from Group II were collected, of which 19 (63.3%) and 71 (89.9%) yielded significant bacterial growth, respectively. A total of 205 isolates belonging to 10 different genera of bacteria were identified, 8 facultative anaerobes and 2 obligate anaerobes. In Group II, 91.6% of the bacteria positive swabs (n = 71) yielded mixed cultures, whereas the remainder being pure cultures. In contrast, 89.5% of the bacteria positive swabs of Group I (n = 19) yielded pure cultures. Mixed infections comprised mostly Arcanobacter (Actinomyces) pyogenes together with obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. In Group II, the frequency of incidental and coliform group bacteria was highest at the time of parturition, i.e., before and immediately after delivery, and decreased to nil during the 24-60-day postpartum period. However, in Group I, the incidental and coliform group of bacteria present at the time of parturition apparently persisted beyond the period when uterine involution is complete. The frequency of obligate anaerobes and A. pyogenes at the time of parturition was nil in the Group I while they predominated in dystocia-affected buffaloes (Group II). During the postpartum period of 24-60 days, the frequency of both obligate anaerobes and A. pyogenes increased significantly in Group II, whereas in Group I, only occasional isolates were obtained. To conclude, at the time of calving the prevalence of obligate anaerobes and A. pyogenes occurring in combination was highest in dystocia-affected buffaloes, and further increased in the postpartum period suggesting that these infections act synergistically.
TI  - [Role of obligate anaerobes in infections in hospitalized patients and therapeutic options].
AB  - Monitoring of prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria, causing infections in hospitalized patients, constitutes a part of a program for prudent use of antibiotics. The aim of the study was to assess prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital in 2001-2002 with reference to empiric antibiotic therapy. The most common gram-positive bacteria were Clostridium difficile--27.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus--21.9% and Actinomyces spp.--11.1%. There was an increase in the number of stool samples positive for C. difficile toxins A and B from 39.4% in 2001 to 59.0% in 2002. The results of susceptibility testing of gram-positive isolates showed the highest percentages of strains susceptible to piperacilin/tazobactam--99.6%, ticarcillin/clavulanate--98.5%, imipenem--98.5%, amoxicillin/clavulanate--97.4% and piperacillin--97.4%. The most prevalent gram-negative anaerobes were strains of Bacteroides spp.--43.1%, Prevotella spp.--35.8% and Fusobacterium spp.--11.0%. All tested strains of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to metronidazole, piperacilin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem. In the analyzed population beta-lactam antibiotics with beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems and metronidazole may be used in empiric therapy of infections caused by strictly anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a Brazilian population II--microbiological results.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (SRP) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned in four treatment groups, a control (C, n=10) that received SRP and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: T1 (n=12): SRP and metronidazole (M, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; T2 (n=12): SRP, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (PC) and placebo; and T3 (n=10): SRP, M and PC. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. Counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. RESULTS: The mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. Counts (x 10(5)+/-SEM) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups T2 and T3. Levels of beneficial species, such as some Actinomyces species, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (T3). Mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group T3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group T2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group T1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group C (NS). Proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: All treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. Adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.
TI  - Effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  - According to the US Surgeon General's report, "Oral Health in America," published in 2000, most adults in the United States show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. Periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. New evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. For this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. This article summarizes laboratory research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. This unique combination of agents is found in Colgate Total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. In addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone resorption. Overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of Colgate Total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.
TI  - Differences in the subgingival microbiota of Swedish and USA subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. METHOD: One hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (N Sweden=79; USA=79) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=4345). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in Swedish than American subjects: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); Streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); Eikenella corrodens (1.7, 1.0); Tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and Prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). Leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in American (5.5) than Swedish subjects (3.0). Cluster analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. Twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. Five clusters were dominated by American subjects and 2 clusters by Swedish subjects. Fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the Swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by high proportions of A. naeslundii genospecies 1, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythensis and P. melaninogenica. Other clusters were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces gerencseriae, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eubacterium saburreum, L. buccalis and Neisseria mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. The heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the American subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the American subjects sampled.
TI  - Identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 'checkerboard' DNA-DNA hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. Dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. The bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. In the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be Actinomyces species. The relative proportion of streptococci, in particular Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis, increased at the expense of Actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of Actinomyces remained unaltered. Periodontal pathogens such as Tannerella forsythensis(Bacteroides forsythus), Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola as well as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of subjects. CONCLUSION: The data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 25261.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. METHODS AND RESULTS: An antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of Pr. nigrescens ATCC 25261. Purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. As revealed by SDS-PAGE, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kDa. The antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Actinomyces spp. Nigrescin was stable in a pH range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees C for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. But its activity was lost after proteinase K treatment. Despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: Nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by Pr. nigrescens ATCC 25261. It exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in periodontal diseases. The absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal treatment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Novel evidence on nigrescin would make Pr. nigrescens ATCC 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.
TI  - Microbiological profile of early onset/aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). Bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. Samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. Indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus, Tannerella forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii. RESULTS: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, and C. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. P. micros and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. Significantly strong positive associations were observed between T. forsythia and C. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and T. forsythia and P. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). Coinfection by P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and C. rectus was observed in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. The sensitivity of immunofluorescence for T. forsythia, C. rectus, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and P. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. The agreement between culture and immunofluorescence in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and T. forsythia, 75.9% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for P. micros. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. The agreement between the two detection methods was very high.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. A study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in Chileans residing in Santiago. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (PD) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (AL) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a history of periodontal therapy were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The microbial data of the Chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from Boston, Massachusetts. Since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean PD, gender, and smoking status. RESULTS: Each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. With the exception of Prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), and Treponema denticola as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Treponerma socranskii. Sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between Chilean and U.S. subjects. Red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the Chileans, while the Actinomyces were higher in the U.S. subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. Thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.
TI  - Transfer of members of the genus Falcivibrio to the genus Mobiluncus, and emended description of the genus Mobiluncus.
AB  - It has long been thought that the genera Mobiluncus and Falcivibrio contain the same organisms. Using a polyphasic approach, it was found that Mobiluncus curtisii and Mobiluncus mulieris were the same as Falcivibrio vaginalis and Falcivibrio grandis, respectively. As the genus name Mobiluncus takes precedence, it is proposed that F. vaginalis and F. grandis be transferred to the genus Mobiluncus. In agreement with previous studies, results from phenotypic tests did not support the separation of M. curtisii strains into its two subspecies, M. curtisii subsp. curtisii and M. curtisii subsp. holmesii. Phenotypic complexity within M. curtisii dictates that the species should be treated as a complex until more in-depth analyses of the species have been performed. Phylogenetic analyses, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrated that the genus Mobiluncus was associated with Varibaculum cambriense and the two subspecies of Actinomyces neuii, and that A. neuii is only distantly related to Actinomyces sensu stricto.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after thoracic surgery].
AB  - Purpose of this study was to find out what kind of anaerobic bacteria were in lower respiratory tract and how often they were present there considering patients after thoracic surgery. Also, what is susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. Research covered 30 patients after operation. Material for research was bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) taken during bronchoscopy. Collected sample was cultivated in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 28 samples (93%). Totally there were 100 anaerobic bacteria strains. The most common Gram-negative rods were from genus Prevotella (24 strains, 24%) and Bacteroides (15 strains, 15%). Gram-negative bacteria except Bacteroides characterised biggest susceptibility to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin, clindamycin and metronidazol. Bacteroides were susceptible to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazol. Among Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria mostly were isolated from cocci Peptostreptococcus (18 strains, 18%) and were susceptible to all antibiotics. Gram-positive rods were in most cases represented by Actinomyces (12 strains 12%) and were highly susceptible to all antibacterial means except metronidazol (100% is resistant).
TI  - Positive and negative bacterial associations involving Dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  - Dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic Gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. In this study, samples taken from abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving D. pneumosintes. DNA was extracted from the samples, and the presence of D. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. Positive and negative associations involving D. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of D. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. The association between the pairs containing D. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. D. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the other target species. D. pneumosintes was positively associated with Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. pectinovorum, and T. vincentii. Negative associations were observed with Bacteroides forsythus, P. gingivalis, and Actinomyces israelii. No pair containing D. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). The findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of D. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen, usually in a mixed infection. Positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as T. denticola and P. endodontalis, suggest that bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.
TI  - Characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In view of its localization, brain abscess (BA) usually requires medical and surgical care. A broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. Recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. A retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented BA admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. BA due to anaerobic bacteria (group A) were compared with other cases (group B) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of BA with isolated anaerobic bacteria. Between 1991 and 2000, BA were diagnosed in 42 patients (28M, 14F, mean age 54.6 y). No differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with BA caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. Using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with BA. Anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. The most frequently isolated species were Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), Prevotella sp. (n = 8), Actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and Bacteroides sp. (n = 4). Compared with group B, group A had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and ear, nose and throat (ENT) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). These results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in BA. The presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ENT infection, or both. Therapy should take into account this high frequency.
TI  - In vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - By using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. Ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of Clostridium difficile for which MICs of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid MICs were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. Nineteen Clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin MIC at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. All strains of Eubacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. Ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the Prevotella and Porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin MICs for all 31 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Fusobacterium mortiferum-Fusobacterium varium group, and Veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. Ramoplanin displays excellent activity against C. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - The use of tetracycline fibres in the treatment of generalised aggressive periodontitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tetracycline fibres (TCF) as an adjunct to scaling in the treatment of generalised aggressive periodontitis and to compare the effects with mechanical treatment only. Ten patients, 24-39 years old referred for treatment to the Department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki took part in the study. A split-mouth experimental design was used. Measurements referring to bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were performed at 12 sites randomly selected. Clinical recordings were made at baseline, 2 and 6 months, after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken for microbiological analysis using the 'checkerboard' DNA-DNA hybridisation technique at baseline, immediately after treatment and at 2 and 6 months. Full-mouth scaling and root planing were performed, with the exception of 2 pre-selected sites, which served as controls. Tetracycline fibres were applied in 5 pockets located in the same half mouth. Analysis of clinical findings showed that mechanical instrumentation in combination with TCF application led to a greater improvement in clinical parameters than scaling and root planing only. Microbial analysis showed a statistically significant greater reduction in the percentages of detection for B. forsythus, P. nigrescens and A. naeslundii genospecies II in pockets where tetracycline fibres were applied. In conclusion, the clinical and microbiological data of the present study suggest that the adjunctive use of TCF improves the clinical response of scaling and root planing in aggressive periodontitis patients.
TI  - Periodontal microbiota and clinical periodontal status in a rural sample in southern Thailand.
AB  - We sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in Thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural China. We examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. Checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. The prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2% and 100%. Discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly 67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. High colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% Confidence Limits (CL) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% CL 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. The data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Faropenem, a new oral penem: antibacterial activity against selected anaerobic and fastidious periodontal isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. The organisms tested comprised Porphyromonas gingivalis (29), Prevotella spp. (eight), Prevotella melaninogenica (seven), Prevotella intermedia (five), Actinomyces spp. (25), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14), Peptostreptococcus spp. (11), Bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and Bacteroides forsythus (two). The antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying MICs, MBCs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Faropenem was highly active against all the anaerobes tested (MIC(90) < or = 0.5 mg/L) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x MIC at between 12 and 24 h. In addition, faropenem had an in vitro PAE on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. Faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Similarity of the oral microbiota of pre-school children with that of their caregivers in a population-based study.
AB  - This study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. Oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in Saipan were assayed using a DNA probe assay. Many species including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces species, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas Bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. A higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. There were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. By logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. In conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. The microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against periodontal anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of penicillin G, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 158 isolates associated with periodontal infections. MIC(50)/MIC(90) values of moxifloxacin were respectively 0.06/0.5 mg/l for Porphyromonas gingivalis (35), for Prevotella spp. (28) and Actinomyces spp. (35), 0.12/0.25 mg/l for Fusobacterium nucleatum (20) and 0.06/0.12 mg/l for Peptostreptococcus spp. (30). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of moxifloxacin for Bacteroides forsythus (6) and Campylobacter rectus (4) was 0.06-0.12 mg/l. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were equal to or 2-4 times the MIC values. Moxifloxacin produced a bactericidal effect at 8 h. Our results show that moxifloxacin has good antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens comparable with that of cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate, and better than that of clindamycin, metronidazole and penicillin.
TI  - Stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. Noradrenaline and adrenaline, which are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. The aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. We established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees C. We assessed organism growth by optical density (OD(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. Test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. We observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. The most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in Actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), Actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), Eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and Campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). We also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for Porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and Bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). Responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. Individual organisms from different microbial complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. Such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - Direct amplification of rRNA gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. METHODOLOGY: Samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a PCR-based identification assay. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. Streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and Bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. No pus sample yielded Actinomyces israelii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. In general, B. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), S. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), F. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and A. israelii in 5% (two of 40). A. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. Fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). There was no correlation between the species and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. There was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an exo-levanase gene from the endophytic bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4.
AB  - Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus produces levan from sucrose by a secreted levansucrase (LsdA). A levanase-encoding gene ( lsdB), starting 51 bp downstream of the lsdA gene, was cloned from strain SRT4. The lsdB gene (1605 bp) encodes a protein (calculated molecular mass 58.4 kDa) containing a putative 36-amino-acid signal peptide at the N-terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 34%, 33%, 32%, and 29% identities with levanases from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bacillus subtilis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Bacteroides fragilis, respectively. The lsdB expression in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter resulted in an active enzyme which hydrolyzed levan, inulin, 1-kestose, raffinose, and sucrose, but not melezitose. Levanase activity was maximal at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C, and it was not inhibited by the metal ion chelator EDTA or the denaturing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. The recombinant LsdB showed a fourfold higher rate of hydrolysis on levan compared to inulin, and the reaction on both substrates resulted in the successive liberation of the terminal fructosyl residues without formation of intermediate oligofructans, indicating a non-specific exo-levanase activity.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles in refractory periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine subgingival microbial profiles associated with refractory periodontitis and to seek such profiles in periodontally healthy, periodontally well-maintained elder and untreated periodontitis subjects. METHODS: 36 subjects were defined as refractory on the basis of further attachment loss after scaling and root planing, surgery and systemically administered antibiotics. A total of 890 subgingival plaque samples (mean/subject=24.7) were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject at baseline and individually processed for their content of 40 subgingival taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Cluster analysis was performed on mean within subject species counts using the chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. Significant differences among clusters for individual and complexes of species were sought using the Kruskal Wallis test. The microbial profiles of the refractory subjects were compared with those of 27 periodontally healthy subjects (n plaque samples=708), 35 periodontally well-maintained elder subjects (n plaque samples=801) and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects (n plaque samples=2871). RESULTS: 28 of 36 refractory subjects fell into 4 clusters with >29% similarity. 10 of 40 species and 4 of 7 complexes differed significantly among clusters. Profile (Cluster) I (n=4) was characterized by high proportions of "yellow" and "green" complex species, profile II (n=3) by low total counts and high proportions of "orange" and "purple" complex species, profile III (n=9) by high total counts and counts of Actinomyces and "purple" complex species, profile IV (n=12) by high proportions of "red" and "orange" complex species. The mean profiles of each cluster were subjected to cluster analysis with microbial data from 4380 (mean 24.7) baseline subgingival plaque samples from 27 periodontally healthy, 35 treated, well-maintained elders and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects. 12 clusters were formed with >41% similarity. 3 of the refractory profiles were detected in 3 cluster groups. Profile II in a cluster of 1 healthy, 1 elder and 4 untreated periodontitis subjects; profile III in a cluster of 1 healthy, 2 elder and 12 periodontitis subjects; Profile IV, with 1 healthy and 5 untreated periodontitis subjects. The profile not detected in non refractory subjects was dominated by Streptococcus species. 9 clusters did not harbor refractory profiles. 11.1% of healthy, 8.6% of elder and 18.3% of periodontitis subjects were in clusters exhibiting refractory microbial profiles. CONCLUSIONS: 4 subgingival microbial profiles were detected among refractory subjects. "Refractory microbial profiles" could be detected in subjects who had not yet exhibited refractory disease.
TI  - Bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis in dogs: a retrospective study of 23 cases (1990-1999).
AB  - The clinical records of 23 dogs (1990-1999) with histopathologically confirmed bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were evaluated retrospectively. No breed, age, sex, or weight predisposition was found. All the dogs presented with clinical signs of a brain lesion, whereas 5 of 23 had neck pain. Pyrexia was detected in 11 of 23 dogs on admission. CBCs revealed neutrophilic leucocytosis in 7 of 21 dogs and thrombocytopenia in 3 of 21 dogs. The serum chemistry profiles were abnormal in 15 of 21 dogs. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were abnormal in 13 of 14 dogs and aerobic CSF culture was positive for bacteria in 1of 8 samples. At postmortem examination, the lesions were localized to the central nervous system. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella spp were the most frequently isolated bacteria from cultures collected at postmortem examination. Twelve papers reporting 51 total clinical cases of canine bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were reviewed. The clinical signs and results of the CBC, serum chemistry, blood culture, and CSF analysis were collated and compared with those of this study. The results of the CSF analysis in this study were similar to those in the literature. CSF cultures documented in the literature were positive for Staphylococcus, Pasteurella. Actinomyces, Nocardia spp, and various anaerobic species including Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological aspects on the use of oxytetracycline and flunixin in primiparous cows with induced retained placenta and post-partal endometritis.
AB  - Retention of the fetal membranes and post-partal endometritis (RFM) are common problems in dairy cows. Treatment often includes manual removal of the placenta in combination with antibiotic treatment. Earlier studies have shown that cows with endometritis post-partum have a strong tendency to recover spontaneously. The present study focused on treatments of post-partal endometritis with the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, flunixin (F) either alone or combined with oxytetracycline (T). The study was conducted in two experiments, using 12 primiparous cows in each. As a model for RFM, premature parturition was induced in late pregnant heifers by injecting PGF2alpha (25 mg i.m.) twice with a 24 h interval. In each experiment the cows were set into four groups and treated with either T (10 mg/kg BW i.m. once daily), F (2.2 mg/kg BW p.o. twice daily), a combination of T and F (dosage, as above) or conservatively (group 0, no drugs). The treatment periods lasted from days 11-14 post-partum in experiment I (groups T1, F1, TF1 and 0) and from days 3-6 post-partum in experiment 2 (groups T2, F2, TF2 and 0). Jugular vein blood samples were collected for analyses of flunixin and total white blood cells. Uterine biopsies were collected twice weekly for investigation of endometrial microbiology. Rectal palpation and ultrasonographic examinations were performed three times weekly for investigations of uterine involution and ovarian activity. No attempts were made to remove the placentas manually. The experiment lasted until day 56 post-partum. The induction of parturition was successful in all heifers and 22 of 24 animals had RFM. All RFM cows had bacterial endometritis. The predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Bacteroides spp., Pasteurella spp. and Proteus spp. Fusobacterium necrophorum and A. pyogenes could be isolated for 3-5 weeks post-partum and E. coli Pasteurella and Proteus could be isolated for 2-3 weeks post-partum. Animals treated with tetracycline after placental shedding (T1 and TF1) had a more rapid recovery from infections with A. pyogenes and F. necrophorum than animals that were not treated with tetracycline. No other genera were affected. Antibiotic treatment before placental shedding (T2 and TF2) did not shorten the uterine infection but altered the bacterial flora, seen as an overgrowth of Proteus spp. (p < 0.05) and increased frequency of Pasteurella (p < 0.05). The alpha-haemolytic streptococci were less common in T2 and TF2 than in other groups (NS). Antibiotic treatment of cows before placental shedding (T2 or TF2, n = 6) postponed detachment of placenta compared to cows were no antibiotics were administered before placental shedding (T1, TF1, F1, F2 and 0, n = 16. 9.8 days pp (median) versus p = 0.004). Neither treatment shortened uterine involution. Flunixin treatments did not seem to influence recovery from infection or uterine involution. It was concluded that early oxytetracycline treatment of retained fetal membranes in the cow did not shorten the uterine involution or uterine infection but it did slow down the detachment process of the retained placenta. Oxytetracycline treatment after placental shedding might shorten the uterine infection but otherwise did not affect the clinical results. Flunixin treatment had no influence on the clinical outcome of the disease.
TI  - BAL 9141, a new broad-spectrum pyrrolidinone cephalosporin: activity against clinically significant anaerobes in comparison with 10 other antimicrobials.
AB  - The in vitro potency of BAL 9141, a new pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, was tested against non-duplicate strains of anaerobic bacteria. The MIC(50) was 1 mg/L against Actinomyces species, Clostridium species, Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, Porphyromonas species, Fusobacterium species, Lactobacillus species, Prevotella species and Veillonella species. The MIC(50) was 16 mg/L for Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides species. BAL 9141 was not active against cefoxitin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - [Use of the Etest method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate Etest usefulness for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes and to compare the activity of five antibacterial drugs against clinical strains of anaerobes. One hundred strains of obligate anaerobes were tested: 2 reference strains (B. fragilis ATCC 25285 and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741) and 98 clinical strains isolated from patients of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital--Center for Trauma Treatment in Warsaw during the last three years (1997-1999). Strains of seven genera of obligate nonsporeforming anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium and Actinomyces) and strains of two sporeforming species (C. perfringens and C. difficile) were examined. The MIC values were determined by the gradient diffusion method Etest (AB BIODISK, Sweden). Wilkins-Chalgren solid medium supplemented with 5% of sheep blood was used. Test plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 48 hours in glove-box (85% N2, 10% H2, 5% CO2). The MIC values for each strain and antimicrobial agent, and the MIC ranges for bacteria of the same species were established. Ten strains resistant to clindamycin, ten resistant to piperacillin, and ten resistant to imipenem were detected. Seven strains were resistant to metronidazole and two strains to piperacillin combined with tazobactam. Tazobactam restored the susceptibility of eight strains to piperacillin. Obtained results confirm that Etest method is useful for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes. Older (clindamycin and metronidazole) and newer (piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem) antimicrobial agents revealed high and comparable activity against clinical strains of obligate anaerobes. The percentage of strains susceptible to tested antimicrobials was > or = 90. These antimicrobials may be still useful in the empiric treatment of infections caused by medically important anaerobes.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Viable bacteria in root dentinal tubules of teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  - Two sets of teeth with apical periodontitis were collected at different geographic locations to study the identity of bacteria left in the root dentinal tubules. Root dentin of 20 of these teeth was cultured from three locations between pulp and cementum (A, B, and C). In addition dentin from eight teeth was examined histologically. Using the culturing technique bacteria were found in 77% of the dentin samples from set 1 (Amsterdam) and in 87.5% of the dentin samples from set 2 (Glasgow). At greater distance, in layer C, from the pulp bacteria were found in 62% (13 of 21) of the dentin samples. Twenty-three percent (3 of 13) of set 1 and 25% (2 of 8) of set 2 contained >50,000 colony-forming units/mg of dentin in layer C. In layers closer to the pulp higher numbers of anaerobic bacteria and gram-positive rods were found, as well as a larger number of bacterial species. Histological sections showed bacterial penetration in dentinal tubules in 5 of 8 teeth. In the other three teeth where the colony-forming units/mg recovered was <10,000, no histological signs of tubule penetration was seen. It seems clear that, in more than half of the infected roots, bacteria are present in the deep dentin close to the cementum and that anaerobic culturing of dentin is more sensitive than histology to detect these bacteria.
TI  - Change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  - AIM: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with SRP. METHOD: After baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth SRP and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, TID, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, TID, n=9). Clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Quade test and between groups using ANCOVA. RESULTS: Mean PD was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. Corresponding values for mean AL were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). Levels and proportions of Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. Counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) of B. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02, 0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180 and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). Corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). Counts of Campylobacter species, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum and Prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. Members of the genera Actinomyces, Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. However, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of Actinomyces species during and after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  - A theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. Bacteria (Streptococcus sobrinus HG1025, Streptococcus oralis J22, Actinomyces naeslundii T14V-J1, Bacteroides fragilis 793E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 974K) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2) was reached. For S. sobrinus HG1025, S. oralis J22, and A. naeslundii T14V-J1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for B. fragilis 793E and P. aeruginosa 974K, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. Subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. For some experimental conditions, like with P. aeruginosa 974K adhering to DDS-coated glass and an air bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. The detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. However, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. At low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. Furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. The shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. The present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms. Hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".
TI  - [The influence of anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma isolated from the genital tract on mast cell activation].
AB  - Nowadays, it is known that mast cells, numerously appearing in all organs and being a source of a wide range of mediators and cytokines, are involved both in physiological and pathological processes. The aim of our study was to examine whether vaginal bacteria, especially those participating in Bacterial vaginosis, are able to activate mast cells to mediators secretion. The study was done on rat peritoneal mast cells. The mast cells were incubated in vitro with suspensions of Bacteroides capillosus, Actinomyces naeslundii (2 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp., Lactobacillus fermentum (2 strains), Mycoplasma hominis or Ureaplasma urealyticum killed by temperature. Activation of mast cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. It was established that M. hominis, U. urealyticum and B. capillosus strongly stimulated rat mast cells to histamine secretion (histamine release 53.0%, 17.4% and 10.0%, respectively). Histamine release induced by Peptostreptococcus spp., A. naeslundii and L. fermentum was lower (at a range of 2.4%-8.2%). The obtained results can suggest that presumably interactions between vaginal bacteria and placental mast cells could influence the course of pregnancy.
TI  - Bacteria of asymptomatic periradicular endodontic lesions identified by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - Possible inclusion of contaminant bacteria during surgery has been problematic in studies of periradicular lesions of endodontic origin. Therefore, in this study, two different surgical techniques were compared. A second problem is that some difficult to cultivate species may not be detected using bacteriological methods. Molecular techniques may resolve this problem. DNA-DNA hybridization technology has the additional advantage that DNA is not amplified. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if bacteria from periradicular endodontic lesions could be identified using DNA-DNA hybridization. A full thickness intrasulcular mucoperiosteal (IS) flap (n = 20) or a submarginal (SM) flap (n = 16) was reflected in patients with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. DNA was extracted and incubated with 40 digoxigenin-labeled whole genomic probes. Bacterial DNA was detected in all 36 lesions. Seven probes were negative for all lesions. In patients with sinus tract communication, in teeth lacking intact full coverage crowns, and in patients with a history of trauma 4-13 probes provided positive signals. Seven probes were positive in lesions obtained by the IS, but not the SM technique. Two probes were in samples obtained with the SM technique, but not the IS. Only Bacteroides forsythus and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 were present in large numbers using either the IS or the SM technique. The SM flap technique, in combination with DNA-DNA hybridization, appeared to provide excellent data pertaining to periradicular bacteria. These results supported other studies that provide evidence of a bacterial presence and persistence in periradicular lesions.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Humoral immunity host factors in subjects with failing or successful titanium dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. However, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. It would be of importance to identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. METHODS: In a retrospective study serum IgG antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (NOTI) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (SOTI) were studied. Serum IgG titers to whole cell Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum IgG antibody titers to S. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with SOTI than in NOTI (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate protection against implant failure as a result of S. aureus infection. Statistically significant higher serum IgG antibody avidity to P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were found in subjects with SOTI than in subjects with NOTI (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. The likelihood that SOTI was associated with a high OD reading for S. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). Whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG antibodies relative to B. forsythus, P. gingivalis and S. aureus may be associated with the outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens In vitro.
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. PDT is a potential adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. However, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. We have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. Potent antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of CFU per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. The use of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of GAR-936 against aerobic and anaerobic animal and human bite wound pathogens.
AB  - GAR-936 is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline with a broad antibacterial spectrum, including tetracycline-resistant strains. The in vitro activities of GAR-936, minocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, penicillin G, and erythromycin were determined by agar dilution methods against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic strains of bacteria (including Pasteurella, Eikenella, Moraxella, Bergeyella, Neisseria, EF-4, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Actinomyces) isolated from infected human and animal bite wounds in humans, including strains resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. GAR-936 was very active, with an MIC at which 90% of the strains are inhibited (MIC(90)) of < or =0.25 microg/ml, against all aerobic gram-positive and -negative strains, including tetracycline-resistant strains of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, except for Eikenella corrodens (MIC(90), < or =4 microg/ml). GAR-936 was also very active against all anaerobic species, including tetracycline-, doxycycline-, and minocycline-resistant strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides tectum, and Peptostreptococcus spp., with an MIC(90) of < or =0.25 microg/ml. Erythromycin- and moxifloxacin-resistant fusobacteria were susceptible to GAR-936, with an MIC(90) of 0.06 microg/ml.
TI  - Comparison of the microbiota of supra- and subgingival plaque in health and periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 22 periodontally healthy (mean age 32+/-16 years) and 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51+/-14 years). METHODS: A total of 2358 supra and separately subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial aspect of all teeth excluding 3rd molars in each subject. Samples were examined for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. Mean counts (x10(5), % DNA probe count and % sites colonized for each species were determined separately for supra and subgingival samples in each subject and then averaged across subjects in the 2 clinical groups. Significance of differences between healthy and periodontitis subjects was determined using the Mann-Whitney test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) for healthy and periodontitis subjects in supragingival plaque were 72.1+/-11 and 132+/-17.5, respectively (p<0.01), and in subgingival plaque 22.1+/-6.6 and 100.3+/-18.4, (p<0.001). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Treponema denticola could be detected in supragingival plaque samples of both healthy and periodontitis subjects. Actinomyces species were the dominant taxa in both supra- and subgingival plaque from healthy and periodontitis subjects. 4 Actinomyces species accounted for 63.2%, of supragingival and 47.2% of subgingival plaque in healthy subjects and 48.% and 37.8% in periodontitis subjects respectively. Increased proportions of P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, and species of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter and Treponema were detected subgingivally in the periodontitis subjects. P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola were significantly more prevalent in both supra- and subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The main differences between supra and subgingival plaque as well as between health and disease were in the proportions and to some extent levels of Actinomyces, "orange" and "red" complex species.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - The short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on the composition of the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with adult periodontitis. A total of 11 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis received apically repositioned flap surgery. Subjects were monitored during a 3-month pretreatment phase, the baseline surgical phase, and for 3 months post-surgery. Clinical assessments including plaque accumulation, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 29 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and percentage of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) were computed for each subject at each visit. After surgery, there was a significant decrease in mean pocket depth and percentage of sites exhibiting gingival redness. Significant decreases were seen in the percentage of sites that had attachment levels < 4 mm, with a significant increase in the percentage of sites with attachment levels of 4 to 6 mm after therapy. The mean total DNA probe count for all bacterial species was significantly decreased by both scaling and root planing and surgical therapy. P gingivalis and B forsythus, 2 bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to mechanical therapy, exhibited statistically significant decreases in mean total DNA probe count. Because surgical therapy decreased levels of the suspected periodontal pathogens C rectus, P nigrescens, and C gracilis, it may be speculated that there was a potential added beneficial effect of surgery on the periodontal microbiota.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  - AIM: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. METHOD: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. Isolates tested included Bacteroides spp. 131, Fusobacterium spp. 12, Prevotella spp. 13, Veillonella spp. 5, Clostridium perfringens 27, other Clostridium spp. 29, Propionibacterium spp. 57, Actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and Peptostreptococcus spp. 48. Ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. RESULTS: Imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. Metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and Clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against Bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of Bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. Penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. Actinomyces and Propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. Variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. Comparison of results with data from a previously published survey showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of Bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and Clostridium species (not C perfringens) to clindamycin. CONCLUSION: Our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - The effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previously, we reported that SRP resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of Bacteroidesforsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola at 3 and 6 months post-SRP in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects were monitored at 9 and 12 months. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of SRP in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. METHOD: Clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to SRP and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. Each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. RESULTS: Mean pocket depth (mm+/-SEM) decreased from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). Mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. Bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola decreased in prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels at 9 and 12 months. Significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at 12 months for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Streptococcus mitis, Capnocytophaga sp, and Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of the oxyrase OxyPlate anaerobe incubation system.
AB  - The Oxyrase OxyPlate anaerobe incubation system was evaluated for its ability to  support the growth of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria previously identified by the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results were compared with those obtained with conventional anaerobe blood agar plates incubated in an anaerobe chamber. We tested 251 anaerobic bacterial strains. Plates were read at 24, 48, and 72 h; growth was scored by a numerical coding system that combines the degree of growth and the colony size. Organisms (number of strains tested) used in this study were Actinomyces (32), Anaerobiospirillum (8), Bacteroides (39), Campylobacter (8), Clostridium (96), Fusobacterium (12), Leptotrichia (8), Mobiluncus (8), Peptostreptococcus (16), and Propionibacterium (24). At 24 h, 101 (40.2%) of the 251 strains tested showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber than with the OxyPlate system, 10 (4.1%) showed better growth with the OxyPlate system, and the remaining 140 (55. 8%) showed equal growth with both systems. At 48 h, 173 (68.9%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 78 (31.1%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. At 72 h, 176 (70.1%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 75 (29.9%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. The OxyPlate system performed well for the most commonly isolated anaerobes but was inadequate for some strains. These results indicate that the Oxyrase OxyPlate system was effective in creating an anaerobic atmosphere and supporting the growth of anaerobic bacteria within 72 h. OxyPlates would be a useful addition to the clinical microbiology laboratory lacking resources for traditional anaerobic culturing techniques.
TI  - Activities of telithromycin (HMR 3647, RU 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and other antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The comparative activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 419 human anaerobic  isolates was determined by the agar dilution method. At concentrations of </=0.5 microgram/ml, telithromycin was active against Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Porphyromonas spp. (including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas macacae), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and almost all Peptostreptococcus species. Clostridia showed species and strain variability, often with a biphasic pattern. Fusobacterium species, except Fusobacterium russii, were relatively resistant.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - [TGF-beta 1 in the experimentally induced inflammatory periodontal tissues in miniature swines].
AB  - TGF-beta 1 is a multifunctional molecule which has unique and potent effects on many target cells and tissues. TGF-beta 1 may promote inflammatory reaction by certain intercellular interaction. TGF-beta 1 at extremely low concentrations shows strong chemotatic activity for mononuclear phagocytes and stimulates bone resorption by enhancing production of PGE2. On the other hand, TGF-beta 1 plays a very important role in the regulation of extracellular matrix turnover presumably by modulating the action of other growth factors on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) expression. TGF-beta 1 was identified intra- and extracellularly in the inflamed gingival tissues and the distribution was associated with areas of inflammation. Sixteen miniature swines were used in this experimental gingivitis/periodontitis study. The ligatures were placed in situ for periods of 3, 5, 8 and 13 weeks and peroral innoculations of Porphyromonas gingivalis/Actinomyces viscosus into the ligatures were carried out only in the experimental group. ELISA was used to measure the levels of TGF-beta 1 in gingival tissues from the experimental and control groups. Recording of the clinical periodontal parameters was performed and the proportion of black-pigmented Bacteroides in the ligature (plaques) removed immediately prior to the biopsies was recorded. The results revealed that the concentration of TGF-beta 1 of the experimental group was higher and significantly different in statistics on the period of third week than that of the control group. The concentration of TGF-beta 1 was significantly different between the third week and the thirteenth week in the experimental group, and was negatively related to the time-length of ligatures. Furthermore, the concentration of TGF-beta 1 was negatively related to the changes of the calculus index and gingival index. These data indicated that the concentration of TGF-beta 1 of gingival tissue exhibited dynamic changes associated with the progression of experimental periodontal inflammation. The levels of TGF-beta 1 in gingival tissue may be valuable in detecting the inflammatory reaction of periodontal tissues.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. The subgingival plaque samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. The results showed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with Bacteroides forsythus. Peptostreptococcus sp., Actinomyces sp. and Prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus and Eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in the healthy subjects.
TI  - The microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  - This study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (NR-group; 11 participants) or responsive (R-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. Microbiological samples from three types of pocket (< 4 mm deep A-samples; 4-5 mm B-samples; > 5 mm C-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. Actinomyces naeslundii, A. israelii, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. The periodontitis pathogens Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the A- and B-samples of both patient groups and in the C-samples of the R-group. In the C-samples of the NR-group their mean counts were 45%. Correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the C-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. The results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. Further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in South Africa.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. Employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees C and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees C, of which seven were propionibacteria. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of nimA genes in Propionibacterium spp. (five strains), Actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), Prevotella bivia (one strain) and Clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimB genes from five strains of Bacteroides fragilis. nimA genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nimA gene source in anaerobic environments.
TI  - The effect of sucrose or starch-based diet on short-chain fatty acids and faecal  microflora in rats.
AB  - An investigation was carried out to determine whether variations of dietary carbohydrates could modify the colonic flora in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with two equicaloric diets based on the AIN-76 diet (American Institute of Nutrition 1977) but differing from that diet in content of carbohydrates, i.e. high sucrose (64%) of high corn starch (64%). Feeding was continued for 9 months ad libitum and no variation in weight gain was recorded among the different diets. A prevalence of aerobes, and a significant reduction in the ratio anaerobes/aerobes in the faeces of rats on the high starch diet compared with the high sucrose diet, was observed. The anaerobe genera identified included Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium. Bacteroides was the most prevalent genus in both dietary groups (51.2 and 29.5% in the faeces of rats fed the sucrose and starch diets, respectively). In contrast, clostridia were prevalent in the starch-fed group (23.8%) and less so in the sucrose diet (11.5%), as propionibacteria were prevalent in faeces of rats fed the starch diet (15.5%), and low in the sucrose diet (3.9%). The remaining genera were scarce in faeces from rats on either diet. Total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were significantly higher in the faeces of animals fed the starch diet compared with those fed the sucrose diet. The relative concentrations of acetic, propionic and butyric acids were not significantly different between the two dietary groups. In conclusion, high starch diet can markedly modify the composition of faecal flora and alter considerably the faecal concentration of SCFAs, compound which might have a health-promoting effect.
TI  - Oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  - The present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. Secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. For this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and 14 were non-smokers. After achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. Plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. Microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of Actinomyces species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus species. At day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). The change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. Changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for Actinomyces species, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia. Within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. No relationship with a single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. It is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  - This investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. Differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Commonly detected species, such as Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. Mean % of sites (+/-SEM) colonized by Bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. The odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when B. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. Mean prevalence for Porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for Treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2 (p<0.001) and for Selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). Similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with PD 0-4 mm were analyzed. The data suggest an etiologic role for B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, T. denticola and S. noxia in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. Subgingival paper point samples were taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). Another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group A) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group B) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. Under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. Low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. There was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group A and group B in morphotypes of the different microflora. The predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus, Stomatococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Neisseria, Veillonella, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Kingella, Porphyromonas and Prevotella species. There was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of Kingella dentrificans isolated from group B sites. However, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (Peptostreptococcus prevotii and Propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (Eubacterium aerofaciens, Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium) was detected. These findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  - This study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a DNA probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. More sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain over the monitoring period. Sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for microbial analysis. Twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). Cultural studies identified Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, and Selenomonas noxia as the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. A. naeslundii, Campylobacter gracilis, and B. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). Health-associated species (10 subjects) included Streptococcus oralis, A. naeslundii, and Actinomyces gerencseriae. DNA probe data identified higher mean levels of B. forsythus and C. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. Cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including B. forsythus and C. rectus. The data suggest that B. forsythus C. rectus and S. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. The differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. Baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the Mann-Whitney test. Most of the 40 species tested, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. Prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus constellatus. The odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if S. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total DNA probe count. Since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using DNA probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. The remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Gemella haemolysans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera Bartonella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Eubacterium, Rothia, Gordona, Gemella, Corynebacterium, Leptotrichia, and Actinomyces. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. As a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of S. constellatus were found.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effects of minocycline-loaded microcapsules in adult periodontitis.
AB  - Clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded (MC), bioabsorbable microcapsules were examined in 15 adult periodontitis patients. Patients received oral hygiene instruction 2 weeks prior to the study. At baseline (day 0) all teeth received supragingival scaling (SC); 2 quadrants received no further treatment and 1 quadrant received subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP). In the fourth quadrant, the tooth with the deepest probing sites (at least 1 site > or = 5 mm) was treated with minocycline microcapsules. The sites were evaluated at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. Clinical indices included bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depths (PD), and attachment loss (AL). Microbiological evaluations included percent morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; cultivable anaerobic, aerobic, and black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB); and percent Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinomyces viscosus by indirect immunofluorescence. In the SC + MC group, BOP, PD, and AL were significantly reduced from baseline for weeks 1 to 6. BOP in the SC + MC group was significantly reduced compared to the SRP group from weeks 2 to 6. In the SC + MC group the percent of spirochetes and motile rods decreased and the percent of cocci increased after 1 week. The increased cocci and decreased motile rods were statistically greater at weeks 4 and 6 in the SC + MC group compared to the SRP group. This study demonstrates that local subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded microcapsules as an adjunct to scaling results in reduction in the percent sites bleeding on probing greater than scaling and root planning alone and induces a microbial response more favorable for periodontal health than scaling and root planing.
TI  - Comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern Cameroon.
AB  - Our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult Cameronians. The aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched Cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction. We also compared cultivation and the Affirm DP test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined and the results were compared statistically. Each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. Results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of the 18 bacterial species. The Gram-positive species Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. Cultivation demonstrated P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared to the checkerboard technique. Furthermore, the Affirm DP test detected P. gingivalis and B. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the Affirm DP test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the healthy and diseased adult Cameronians were similar to those reported for adults in the West and in some developing countries.
TI  - Evaluation of the BBL Crystal Anaerobe identification system.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Anaerobe (ANR) identification system was evaluated, and the results were compared with those from conventional anaerobic methods. We tested 322 clinically significant anaerobic bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions. The system identified correctly 286 of 322 (88.8%) of the anaerobic bacteria tested. Of these, 263 of 322 (81.7%) were identified correctly on initial testing and 49 were identified correctly only to the genus level; on repeat testing, 23 of 49 (46.9%) were identified correctly to both the genus and the species levels. A total of 26 (8.5%) were misidentified at the species level, and 10 (3.1%) were not identified. Performance characteristics for individual strains varied. The system correctly identified all tested strains of Campylobacter, Desulfomonas, Desulfovibrio, Leptotrichia, Mobiluncus, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Provetella, Propionibacterium, Tisierella, and Veillonella and 36 of 37 (97.3%) Actinomyces strains, 42 of 46 (91.3%) B. fragilis group strains, 79 of 103 (76.7%) Clostridium strains, (however, the system failed to identify any of the 7 C. innocuum and 9 C. tetani strains tested), and 8 of 15 (53.3%) Bacteroides strains. This system was easy to use, did not involve the addition of reagents, and was faster than conventional anaerobic procedures. It would be a useful addition to the anaerobe laboratory of most hospitals.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of subjects with adult periodontitis who responded poorly to scaling and root planing.
AB  - In a previous report, it was shown that scaling and root planing (SRP) decreased  mean pocket depth and attachment level in subjects with adult periodontitis, as well as the levels and prevalence of Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. However, a subset of subjects in that study exhibited mean loss of attachment following SRP. The purpose of the present investigation was to seek clinical and microbiological differences between subjects who responded well or poorly to SRP. 57 subjects with adult periodontitis were treated by full-mouth SRP under local anaesthetic. Clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, BOP, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth prior to and 3 months post-SRP. Attachment level measurements were repeated at each visit and differences in means between visits used to assess change. 18 subjects showed mean attachment loss 3 months post-SRP (poor response group), while 39 showed mean attachment level gain (good response group). The prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa in subgingival plaque samples from the mesiobuccal site of each tooth (maximum 28 sites) in each subject prior to and 3 months post-SRP were assessed using checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization. The prevalence of each species was computed for each subject and averaged across subjects in the 2 treatment-response groups at each visit. Differences between groups were sought using the Mann-Whitney test. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 response groups in any clinical parameter prior to therapy. Subjects in the good response group showed more attachment level gain at sites with baseline pocket depths of < 4 mm, 4-6 and > 6 mm than poor response subjects. Of 40 species evaluated, A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus), T. denticola, C. gracilis and C. rectus were significantly higher and more prevalent pre-therapy in the good response subjects. Mean attachment level change post SRP could be predicted using multiple linear regression with A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) and T. denticola as the predictor variables (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.00001). Sites that gained > or = 2 mm of attachment post therapy showed a significant decrease in the counts of P. gingivalis (7.5 +/- 3.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)), T. denticola (8.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(5)) and B. forsythus (11.1 +/- 5.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)). The data of the present investigation indicate that SRP is most effective in subjects and sites with high levels of the subgingival species that this therapy affects.
TI  - Recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  - A new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16S rRNA sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. The pigmented Prevotella species now comprise seven species including P. nigrescens and P. tannerae; P. intermedia/P. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. The former Mitsuokella dentalis and Hallella seregens were transferred to Prevotella as one species, P. dentalis. P. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting Prevotella. The genus Porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, P. catoniae; P. levii-like and P. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. Fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies, and F. varium includes the former F. pseudonecrophorum. Former Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva now are Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter curvus; Campylobacter showae is a new species. Isolates included in the bile-sensitive former Bacteroides gracilis now are Campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant B. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, Sutterella, as S. wadsworthensis. The new Actinomyces species include two subspecies of the A. neuii and the A. radingae-A. turicensis complex. The genus Eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by E. limosum, and the former E. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, Pseudoramibacter, as P. alactolyticus. Recent entries include E. saphenum, E. minutum, E. exiguum, E. infirmum, and E. tardum. A new genus, Atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. The genus Peptostreptococcus also have four new species; P. hydrogenalis, P. lacrimalis, P. lactolyticus, and P. vaginalis.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - beta-Lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  - In 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. In addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus and Campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (DrySlide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. Isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. Based on the non-selective plates, six of 23 P. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 B. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 F. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. The beta-lactamase positive species Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella buccalis and Actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-Lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range < 0.01-15%). Comparison of the DrySlide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-Lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). It was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a common feature. However, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. The majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found among species of the Prevotella genus.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. Twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. Clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [PIPD], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). Based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. A mean PIPD of 3.6 mm was found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the PIPD and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. The subjects harboring Prevotella intermedia showed presence of PIPD of > or = 5 mm. All subjects harbored Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and other Prevotella species. Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. Three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. They harbored higher proportions of Peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. The results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. The results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. It is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with extrahepatic infection.
AB  - We present two cases that support an infectious cause of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Each patient had sepsis due to chronic abdominal abscesses, along with a liver mass. Both patients had exploratory celiotomy, and histologic examination of the liver mass revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Evidence of a mixed bacterial/Actinomyces infection was noted in hepatic tissue sections in one patient, and Bacteroides caccae was cultured directly from the liver biopsy in the other patient. This is the first known report of bacteria being cultured from biopsy specimens of a hepatic pseudotumor and the only reported case of Actinomyces within a hepatic pseudotumor. Clinical and pathologic findings in these two cases indicate that an extrahepatic infectious source should be explored as a potential cause of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver.
TI  - Isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of obligate anaerobic bacteria recovered from the uteri of dairy cows with retained fetal membranes and postparturient endometritis.
AB  - The uteri of 77 postparturient dairy cows were sampled. Samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically, and the nature of bacterial growth was identified. A mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacterial infection was found in 55% of the samples. Actinomyces pyogenes was the predominant aerobic species; it was found in 70% of the samples, whereas Bacteroides melaninogenicus was the most frequent anaerobic species isolated. Altogether, 16 species belonging to the genus Bacteroides were identified with variable frequencies. It appears that more than one Bacteroides species colonizes the uterus of a given cow postpartum. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin for 83 anaerobic isolates were determined. All isolates were susceptible to clindamycin (MIC90 of 0.064 microgram/ml) and all but two to metronidazole. Susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was variable, with a bimodal distribution of MIC values. The MIC of tetracycline for 90% of the isolates was > 256 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Antimicrobial properties of Flos Lonicerae against oral pathogens].
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of Flos Lonicerae on oral pathogens was studied. The results showed that 73.9% of the tested pathogens were inhibited at a concentration below 6.25mg/ml. Streptococci mutants, actinomyces viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus were comparatively more sensitive to Flos Lonicerae.
TI  - Isolation of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria from feline subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  - A total of 113 specimens collected from purulent skin lesions of household cats was examined bacteriologically. Ninety seven isolates obtained from 74 specimens (65.5%). Of these, 11 specimens (9.7%) contained obligate anaerobes only, 18 specimens (15.9%) yielded both obligate and facultative anaerobes. In the obligate anaerobes detected, genus Fusobacterium was the most frequently observed and F. nucleatum was most common species. Pasteurella multocida was the facultative anaerobe which was most frequently detected.
TI  - Microbiological and serological investigations of oral lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - Microbiological and serological (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) investigations were carried out, including karyotyping, on two Asian children with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. In case 1, a girl aged four years, the most prevalent putative periodontopathogens were Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia (deciduous dentition) and Bacteroides gracilis, E corrodens and F nucleatum (permanent dentition). In case 2, a boy aged nine years, they were F nucleatum, P intermedia and P loeschii and E corrodens. Serum from case 2 showed a raised specific IgG antibody response to Actinomyces actino-mycetemcomitans serotype b. Thus, a wider range of species than hitherto reported may be associated with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, including A actino-mycetemcomitans and F nucleatum.
TI  - Rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  - Eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate tests. Identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. Characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five Porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting Prevotella species, Bacteroides forsythus, three Capnocytophaga species, six Actinomyces species, four Propionibacterium species, and eight Streptococcus species. Two mannoside isomers differentiated Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae. In addition to Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium alocis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces meyeri, and Bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. Fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. The method was ideal for rapidly obtaining presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as SDS-PAGE.
TI  - Intrauterine bacterial findings and hormonal profiles in post-partum cows with normal puerperium.
AB  - The post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 Swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. Uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. Bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. The main PGF2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-PGF2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. The cows were assigned to 2 groups: Group I (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and Group II (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. A total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. Thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. The 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the Group II cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. Actinomyces pyogenes along with Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. The bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. The average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. The plasma levels of the PGF2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in Group I and Group II, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the duration of PGF2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). Progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. Thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of PGF2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. However, the longer duration of PGF2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.
TI  - [Occurrence of non-spore forming anaerobic bacteria in the upper airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of anaerobic non-sporeforming  bacteria upper airways flora in the exacerbation of COPD. Sputum from 35 COPD patients was sent to the laboratory in sterile, filled with CO2 containers and cultured under anaerobic conditions. In all patients bacteriological tests were positive. The most common anaerobic bacteria were as follows: Peptostreptococcus - in 28 pts, Fusobacterium - in 27 pts, Bacteroides - in 26 pts and Prevotella in 24. Less common were: Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Porphyromonas and Peptococcus. The susceptibility to most common antimicrobial agents was evaluated. All anaerobic bacteria show a significant sensitivity to amoxicillin either with clavulanic acid or ampicillin with sulbactam. Gram-positive rods were resistant to metronidazole and tinidazole.
TI  - Human root caries: microbiota of a limited number of root caries lesions.
AB  - The microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. Fourteen lesions were examined. The experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. Dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective Columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for Lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. The cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using Rapid ID 32A, Rapid ID 32 Strep, API 20 Strep, APIZYM, and API50 CH tests and SDS-PAG electrophoresis. In initial as well as in advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the CFUt. The proportion of Actinomyces, and in particular A. naeslundii was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. In contrast, the percentage of Streptococcus and especially S. mutans was higher (p < 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. Surprisingly low (0.8% of the CFUt) was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. Gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. Among the gram-negative isolates, Prevotella, Selenomonas, and Bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. In advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. It is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. The necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. The creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. This might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.
TI  - Susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 Actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 S. uberis isolates, 3 S. acidominimus isolates, 2 Streptococcus spp., 15 Peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 Fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates except one Bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin G, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the B. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Similar trends were noted for susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (MIC90s, 2.0 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. Tinidazole was active against all anaerobes (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-Lactamase was produced only by the B. fragilis isolate.
TI  - Cell envelope and cell wall immunization of Macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  - The nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. The high P. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low P. gingivalis numbers being recovered. P. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable P. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Bacteroides macacae and Prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp. and Eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. Campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of Fusobacterium spp. decreased. Plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. Pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth. Attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups, and the F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. Radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. Although immunization with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted in greater bone loss than immunization with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.
TI  - Non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  - The magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (NSA) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). Children below the 6 months age group bear less risk of acquiring NSA infection. Under certain situations, metronidazole combats NSA infections in a better way than other antibacterials. The bacteriology of NSA infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. The species of normal cervix (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. Out of the 22 species of NSA isolated, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. Others were Peptococcus niger, Gaffkya anaerobia, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Actinomyces bovis, Bacteroides oralis, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. The weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. The umbrella of antibacterials reduced Gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. The facultative anaerobes Staph aureus, Staph epidermidis, Kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Studies into the microbial spectrum of apical periodontitis.
AB  - This study examined the variety of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacterial species recovered from cases of acute apical periodontitis. A total of 19 root canal samples and 24 periapical granuloma samples were taken from patients suffering pain and discomfort. Bacteria were identified by applying the following techniques: culturing on various media, Gram-staining and using commercially available biochemical test strips. In addition, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas endodontalis were differentiated on a molecular genetic level using species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes. The most frequently identified bacteria were Prevotella intermedia, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus milleri-group and Bacteroides spp. Obligate anaerobes occurred at a rate of 82.3%, and the average number of isolates was 6.4 per sample.
TI  - Microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  - A total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% Gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. A subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. Subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. At baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters measured at the 7 different time points. The control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable Neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of P. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. After 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. Analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly Veillonella dispar. This study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ampicillin, cefoperazone and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that of other antibiotics against anaerobic organisms].
AB  - Susceptibility of 180 strains of anaerobic organisms to ampicillin, cefoperazone  and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole was studied with the method of serial microdilutions. 100 per cent of the strains was susceptible to the ampicillin + cefoperazone combination. Only 1 strain of Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to imipenem. 73.4 and 57.8 per cent of the B. fragilis strains were susceptible to cefoxitin and cefoperazone respectively. No resistance to metronidazole was detected. 100 per cent of the strains belonging to Bacteroides spp. fragilis (gr.) and Prevotella spp. was resistant to all the antibiotics except ampicillin. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were susceptible to all the antibiotics. The strains of Actinomyces spp. and Propionibacterium acnes were resistant to metronidazole. Only 48.7 per cent the Actinomyces strains was susceptible to cefoxitin.
TI  - Chest wall actinomycosis in association with the use of an intra-uterine device.
AB  - A 31 year old woman presented with a chest wall abscess due to Actinomyces israellii and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (previously Bacteroides asaccharolyticus). She was a long-term user of an intra-uterine device (IUD) and, although asymptomatic, had radiological evidence of pelvic infection. Actinomyces-like organisms were seen on cervico-vaginal smears. The abscess was surgically drained, the IUD removed, and a prolonged course of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid given.
TI  - Detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on Trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. Each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M). Both PCR amplification and DNA hybridization, using a fragment of tet(M) from Tn1545, were used to detect tet(M). The PCR primers (5'-GACACGCCAGGACATATGG-3' and 5'-TGCTTTCCTCTTGTTCGAG-3') were chosen to amplify a 397 bp region of tet(M). Tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. The percentage of tet(M)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83% (mean of 10%). tet(M) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. The tet(M) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly S. intermedius, S. oralis, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus SM4), Actinomyces D01 (14%), Bifidobacterium D05 (11%), and Veillonella spp. (10%). Tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(M) was not detected included the Prevotella and Bacteroides species (41%, mainly Bacteroides D28, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. oris). These results suggest that tet(M) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of S. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not considered to be periodontopathogens. Assessment of other tetracycline-resistant genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of an improved stannous fluoride dentifrice.
AB  - Recently, a new stabilized stannous fluoride (SnF2) dentifrice (SSF) has been developed. The aim of the present work was to examine the antimicrobial activity of SnF2, and to assess the long-term microbial safety of this dentifrice in a series of in vitro and clinical evaluations. Results of in vitro time-kill experiments with representative oral bacteria demonstrated that SnF2 exerts broad antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives and, in particular, has potent activity against Streptococcus mutans. Sixty-eight subjects participated in a nine-day plaque regrowth clinical study to assess the short-term antiplaque effect of SSF. The results revealed no significant differences from the negative control, suggesting that SnF2 does not detectably or directly alter plaque microbial viability or composition. Separately, evaluation of microbial safety in a subgroup of 120 subjects participating in a six-month clinical efficacy and safety trial found no significant ecological shifts between SSF and the negative (NaF dentifrice) control among 11 supragingival microbial populations examined. The potential for development of bacterial resistance to SnF2 was assessed under both in vitro and clinical conditions. In a rigorous assessment of the ability of bacterial populations to develop either phenotypic or genotypic resistance to SnF2, representative bacteria were exposed to continuous sub-lethal concentrations of SnF2 in a laboratory chemostat for at least 9 days. Results of time-kill experiments on exposed populations revealed no significant changes in susceptibility despite exposure of over 10(12) bacteria. Based on typical spontaneous mutation rates of 10(-6) to 10(-8), these results suggested that the potential for bacteria to develop resistance to SnF2 is low. Evaluation of susceptibility to SnF2 to over 800 bacterial isolates obtained over the course of the six-month clinical trial corroborate the in vitro findings, revealing no changes in susceptibility suggestive of development of resistance to SnF2 is a microbiologically safe agent for oral use and support separate clinical observations demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this stabilized SnF2 dentifrice.
TI  - Human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  - The plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. From each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. The experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. Plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. Plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective Columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for Lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. The cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using Rapid ID 32A, Rapid ID 32 Strep, API 20 Strep, API ZYM, and API 50 CH tests and SDS-PAG electrophoresis. Regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. In addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly Bacteroides, Prevotella, Selenomonas, Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. On all surfaces Actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. With respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella buccae and Selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. The total CFU's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. In general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with A. naeslundii, Capnocytophaga spp., and Prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.
TI  - Predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. The examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were found to be predominant in severe periodontal lesions. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species, C. ochracea, Haemophilus segnis and Veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Intrauterine bacterial findings in postpartum cows with retained fetal membranes.
AB  - Eleven Swedish postpartum cows with retained fetal membranes (RFM) were studied to determine the intrauterine bacterial flora. Bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. A total of 161 biopsies were collected during the first 8 weeks postpartum of which 82 (50.9%) were found with bacterial growth. Seventy-one of the 82 bacteria-positive biopsies (86.6%) showed mixed infections whereas the remaining 11 (13.4%) were pure cultures. Generally, a total of 322 isolates belonging to 12 different genera of bacteria, 6 facultative and 6 obligate anaerobic pathogens were identified. Mixed infections were most frequent for Actinomyces pyogenes together with obligate anaerobic bacteria, especially Bacteroides levii/spp. and Fusobacterium necrophorum. All of the studied cows had an infection that involved the first two genera of bacteria, whereas F. necrophorum was found in 8 of the 11 animals. The present work suggests that a possible pathogenic synergism between A. pyogenes and the two main Gram-negative anaerobes might have caused early endometritis and/or persistent infection.
TI  - Anaerobic pericarditis: case report and review.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is uncommon and is rarely caused by anaerobic bacteria. We  describe a 58-year-old man with purulent pericarditis secondary to infection with Bacteroides fragilis; the most likely source for the B. fragilis infection was subsequently found to be a ruptured appendix. His pericarditis eventually resolved after drainage of purulent fluid and treatment with antibiotics directed against B. fragilis. We also review 29 cases of anaerobic pericarditis previously reported in the English-language literature (we excluded those cases due to actinomyces). In 17 cases only anaerobic bacteria were isolated, while in 13 anaerobes were isolated with a mixture of facultative and/or aerobic bacteria. The cases were secondary to a contiguous focus of infection or occurred via hematogenous seeding. Treatment of both anaerobic pericarditis and purulent pericarditis due to aerobic bacteria entails adequate drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, and in all cases there should be a search for the source of the organism infecting the pericardium.
TI  - Relationship of oral microflora with oral health status in Parkinson's disease.
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) patients report an increased craving for sweets, which may have an effect on microflora. We compared patients of PD who crave sweets with PD patients who do not. Age- and sex-matched control subjects were used, with 14 subjects in each group. A plaque sample was taken from tooth #18 with a curette and placed into RTF, homogenized, and plated onto selective and non-selective media. Microflora were expressed as % CFU's of total anaerobes. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Newman-Keuls on log-transformed data. No statistical difference was observed among the three groups for lactobacilli, bacteroides, fusobacteria, veillonella, and actinomyces. S. mutans was lower in controls than in PD patients. Apparently, the craving for sweets in PD patients does not result in a significant increase in % of total anaerobes of certain microflora. PD patients showed a significant increase in mucositis compared with the control groups.
TI  - Bacteria invading periapical cementum.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms invade periapical cementum of human teeth from the adjacent periapical lesions. We therefore attempted to isolate microorganisms from periapical cementum through the adoption of standard anaerobic procedures for obligate anaerobes. Samples of cementum were taken from 10 amputated tooth roots at the time of apicoectomy. From two of these samples, bacteria were recovered after anaerobic incubation, but no bacteria were recovered after aerobic incubation of the same samples. Of a total of eight isolates from the cementum, seven were obligate anaerobes and one was aerotolerant. The obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to the genera Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and Fusobacterium. The aerotolerant anaerobe was Campylobacter. From this, we conclude that bacteria can successfully invade cementum via periapical periodontal tissue, and that such bacteria may play a significant role in chronic periapical pathosis.
TI  - Laser-induced autofluorescence for medical diagnosis.
AB  - The naturally occurring autofluorescence of cells and tissues is based on biomolecules containing intrinsic fluorophores, such as porphyrins, the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, and the coenzymes NADH, NADPH, and flavins. Coenzymes fluoresce in the blue/green spectral region (fluorecence lifetimes: 0.5-6 ns) and are highly sensitive indicators of metabolic function. Steadystate and time-resolved blue-green autofluorescence is, therefore, an appropriate measure of the function of the respiratory chain as well as of cellular and tissue damage. Autofluorescence in the yellow/red spectral region is based mainly on endogenous porphyrins and metalloporphyrins, such as coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin (fluorescence lifetime of porphyrin monomers: >10 ns), and Zn-protoporphyrin (2 ns). Various pathological microorganisms such asPropionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae are able to synthesize large amounts of these fluorophores and can therefore be located. This permits fluorescence-based detection of a variety of diseases, including early-stage dental caries, dental plaque, acne vulgaris, otitis externa, and squamous cell carcinoma. The sensitivity of noninvasive autofluorescence diagnostics can be enhanced by time-gated fluorescence measurements using an appropriate time delay between ultrashort laser excitation and detection. For example, videocameras with ultrafast shutters, in the nanosecond region, can be used to create "caries images" of the teeth. Alternatively, autofluorescence can be enhanced by stimulating protoporphyrin biosynthesis with the exogenously administered porphyrin precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The fluorophore protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) is photolabile and photodynamically active. Irradiation of PP IX-containing tissue results in cytotoxic reactions which correlate with modifications in fluorescence due to photobleaching and singlet oxygen-dependent photoproduct formation. Therefore, on-line autofluorescence measurements during the phototreatment can yield information on the efficiency of ALA-based photodynamic therapy.
TI  - Relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  - To investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). Clinical measurements were recorded at the Ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. In addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (LA) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. Microbiological samples were taken from one of the Ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal LA), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with LA, and from the saliva. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. Furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. It is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. Among the periodontal pathogens, only P. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal LA (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). This finding was irrespective of the secretor status. Therefore, P. intermedia may be an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.
TI  - Coaggregation between bacterial species.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation, or interbacterial adherence, is one mechanism involved in the development of bacterial biofilms that are found on surfaces in nature. Assays used to measure coaggregation rely on the interaction of bacterial cells in suspension or attachment of one species to a second species that has been fixed to a solid substrate. Both semiquantitative and quantitative assays are described. These methods have also been used to determine the nature of the adherence and molecules involved in mediating the interaction, to characterize potential inhibitors, to isolate the bacterial adhesins and receptors, and to isolate adherence-deficient mutant strains. Each of the assay systems offers different advantages, with significant variations in sensitivity. Selection of a particular assay system should depend on the goals of the study to be performed.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - [The distribution of normal oral flora in 49 healthy children and juvenile].
AB  - The frequencies and proportions of predominant cultiv ableoral bacteria associated with 49 healthy children and juvenile (6-25 yr old) were studied. A total of 72 bacterial species belonging to 28 genus were detected in 195 samples of saliva, fissure plaque, supragingival plaque, and subgingival plaque. The predominant bacteria were Oral streptococci, Neisseria, Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium in the normal oral cavity of healthy children and juvenile. There were differences in the distribution of the predominant flora, e.g. Fusobacterium and Bacteroides had higher incidence and proportion in the subgingival plaque than in the fissure plaque.
TI  - Microbial colonization of dental implants in partially edentulous subjects.
AB  - This study assessed the colonization of Branemark dental implants by periodontopathic bacteria in four partially edentulous patients with a total of 10 implants. Marginal and subgingival plaque on the implants was sampled 14 days and 28 days after second-stage surgery and compared with plaque from three teeth closest to the implant sites sampled before second-stage surgery (baseline) and at 14 and 28 days. Slot immunoblot assay was used to determine the presence or absence of bacterial antigen to six different periodontopathic microorganisms. In general, colonization of marginal implant plaque occurred within 14 days, whereas subgingival colonization took longer and occurred within 28 days. It appears that Branemark dental implants placed in partially edentulous patients may be colonized by disease-associated bacteria within 14 days of second-stage surgery.
TI  - In vitro study of the penetration of three bacterial strains into root dentine.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess in vitro migration of the following three bacterial species into dentinal tubules: Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Prevotella intermedia. Twenty-seven bovine incisors were randomly divided into three groups. Only the root dentin was used for the experiment. Within each group, the nine incisors were sectioned into 36 dentin blocks that were incubated with one of the tested bacterial suspensions. Twelve samples were taken after 10, 20, and 28 days. Half the samples were observed with scanning electron microscopy and the others with light microscopy after standard histologic procedures, and the depth of bacterial penetration was measured. Analysis of the examinations showed that whatever the technique used, only one strain on this experimental model migrated into dentinal tubules. S. sanguis was observed at a depth of 792 microns, but no migration was observed for either A.naeslundii or P.intermedia. The differences in migration of the bacteria tested appear to be related to their morphologic factors and cellular arrangement.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - A comparative study of cephradine, amoxycillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of acute dentoalveolar infection.
AB  - A comparative double blind trial was undertaken of the efficacy of cephradine, amoxycillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of acute dentoalveolar abscesses. Patients were admitted to the trial with acute dentoalveolar abscesses with systemic involvement and assessments were made of pain, swelling, temperature and lymphadenopathy. After admission to the trial appropriate surgical therapy was undertaken. The patients were then given either phenoxymethylpenicillin 250 mg four times daily, cephradine 500 mg twice daily or amoxycillin 250 mg three times daily, all for 5 days. The patients were assessed after 2 days and 5 days. All the patients recovered with those taking cephradine showing the best recovery in the first two days of treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from University departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. Susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified Wilkins-Chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. Anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the University departments were mainly resistant Bacteroides spp., especially Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, Peptostreptococcus spp, Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. The study shows that the members of most Bacteroides spp. encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.
TI  - Characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. Twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Actinobacillus). Nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four Prevotella denticola strains, two Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of P. melaninogenica, Streptococcus constellatus, and A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. Incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. With one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the S. constellatus isolate. Genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Hemolytic clones were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). Extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three P. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. Two of the P. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 Kb inserts. The clone derived from the third strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 Kb region, but the flanking DNA showed no homology even though all three P. denticola isolates were shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Coaggregation of Prevotella intermedia with oral Actinomyces species.
AB  - Five strains of Prevotella intermedia were examined for their ability to coaggregate with various gram-positive and gram-negative species of oral bacteria. Two of the P. intermedia strains coaggregated with selected Actinomyces species, P. intermedia 27 with Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, PK606, PK984, and PK947, and P. intermedia 113 with Actinomyces odontolyticus WVU 1546 and Actinomyces israelii WVU 838. Exposure of both Prevotella strains but not the Actinomyces strains to heat, trypsin, or proteinase K abolished most coaggregations. All pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but only those coaggregations involving P. intermedia 113 were reversed by the addition of 2.0 M urea. P. intermedia 27 was sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the partner strains were stable to this treatment. Most coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva; however, reactions involving P. intermedia 27 were not as strong as those of buffer-suspended cells. Treatment of both P. intermedia 113 coaggregations pairs with proteinase K and the results obtained from suspensions of these pairs in saliva suggest that different surface molecules of this P. intermedia strain may mediate each of these coaggregations. These data suggest that all of these coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the Prevotella strain, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the Actinomyces strain.
TI  - A review of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics in general dentistry.
AB  - The microflora associated with odontogenic infections are typically mixed and of  indigenous origin. Streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and actinomyces species are the principle microflora isolated from these infections. Penicillin V (phenoxymethyl penicillin) remains the antimicrobial of choice for the initial empirical treatment of odontogenic infections. This agent is safe, highly effective and inexpensive. Amoxicillin has little indication for the routine treatment of odontogenic infections. However, it is the agent of choice for endocarditis prophylaxis, as it produces higher serum levels than penicillin V. Erythromycin may be used for mild, acute odontogenic infections in penicillin-allergic patients. The high incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances and superinfection commonly associated with the ingestion of tetracycline limits its role in general dental practice. Tetracycline may be considered as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic patients over the age of 13 who cannot tolerate erythromycin. Clindamycin is very effective against all odontogenic pathogens, but its potential gastrointestinal toxicity relegates it to third- or even fourth-line therapy in general dentistry. Although metronidazole displays excellent activity against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, it is only moderately effective against facultative and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and should not be used alone in the treatment of acute odontogenic infections.
TI  - [Study of obligate anaerobic bacterial sensitivity to tinidazole and metronidazole (determination of minimal inhibiting concentration--MIC)].
AB  - Comparative susceptibility testing of 428 strains of obligate anaerobic bacteria  belonging to genera Propionibacterium, Arachnia, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Anaerorhabdus, Fibrobacter, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium to metronidazole and tinidazole was performed. The study of the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria was carried out by the method of serial dilution in Brucella agar according to Finegold and Sutter (1972). Strains of B. fragilis species, B. fragilis group, other Bacteroides spp.. Fusobacterium spp. and Clostridium spp. were susceptible to both chemotherapeutics in clinically attainable concentrations. Of particular significance is the greater susceptibility of these bacteria to tinidazole. Taking into account this activity, tinidazole is a superior agent in the treatment of anaerobic infections. Both chemotherapeutics were not active against, rarely isolated from severe infections. Gram-positive anaerobic rods from genera Propionibacterium. Actinomyces and Arachnia and were partially active against peptostreptococci.
TI  - The association of carious dentin microflora with tissue changes in human pulpitis.
AB  - Correlations were sought between the number and type of microorganisms recovered  from sampled carious dentin and the cellular responses observed in dental pulpal tissues from a sample of 65 vital, carious teeth extracted from adult humans who had declined the option of tooth restoration. Standardized homogenates of carious dentin were plated using selective and nonselective media under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Pulpal responses were characterized histopathologically on the basis of the nature of the cellular infiltrate and the extent of degenerative changes. A significant association between the number of Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella melaninogenica in carious dentin and extensive, principally mononuclear, inflammatory infiltration was evident despite a high degree of complexity and intersubject variability in the microbial flora. There was no apparent association between other microorganisms or total microbial load and the histopathological category.
TI  - Effect of LongoVital treatment on development of periodontal disease in rats.
AB  - LongoVital is a herbal tablet with documented immunostimulatory effects in man. In the present study the effect of LongoVital on development of periodontal disease was investigated in a rat model. Fifty-four conventional rats, 5 wk old, were distributed into the following groups: A) untreated, uninfected; B) untreated, infected with Actinomyces viscosus and Porphyromonas gingivalis wk 8; C) treated with LongoVital 80 mg x 3/wk, wk 5-14, uninfected; D) treated with LongoVital 80 mg x 3/wk, wk 5-14, infected with A. viscosus and P. gingivalis wk 8; E) treated with LongoVital 200 mg x 1 in wk 8 and 80 mg wk 9-14, uninfected; F) infected with A. viscosus and P. gingivalis wk 8, subsequently treated with LongoVital 200 mg x 1 in wk 8 and 80 mg wk 9-14. All animals were killed when they were 15 wk old, and periodontal bone support was assessed radiographically. Statistically significant bone loss was found in untreated, infected rats, as compared with untreated, uninfected rats. In LongoVital-treated animals, no significant difference was seen in bone level between infected and uninfected rats. These results indicate that LongoVital-treated rats were protected against periodontal bone loss caused by infection with A. viscosus and P. gingivalis. Furthermore, the protection seemed effective both when LongoVital was administered prophylactically and after exposure to periodontal pathogens. The active components of LongoVital, as well as the mechanisms responsible for the protection, remain obscure.

TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Correlation between thermal sensitivity and microorganisms isolated from deep carious dentin.
AB  - The correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. The numbers of lactobacilli and total Gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. The presence of Gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented Bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. Black-pigmented Bacteroides, Streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. Recovery of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. Total counts of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. It appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. Conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded with shorter duration of pain.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the pH responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  - Comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in pH than does glucose. In vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. Pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no pH response with this sugar. This suggested that the smaller decreases in pH seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. Variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. In the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose pH responses. These showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the pH by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. The effects were different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. The corresponding acid-base pH profiles for pure cultures were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
AB  - Immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. A total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. The mean percentages of IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. The highest titers determined by ELISA belonged to the IgG1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. The concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. The functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, and Wolinella. Minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. High-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.
TI  - Nonspecific antibacterial factors in milk from cows immunized with human oral bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Both the immunoglobulins and non-specific antibacterial factors in milk from cows immunized with pathogenic oral bacteria have the potential to influence the oral microflora during passive immunization studies. The first six milks after calving were collected from 2 cows immunized with adjuvant and from 14 cows immunized with adjuvant and heat-killed strains of periodontopathic Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Analysis of the products from the first to the sixth milks revealed that the protein and lysozyme content decreased approximately 66 and 72%, respectively; the mean specific activity of the enzyme remained relatively constant. In contrast, the mean lactoperoxidase activity increased 2.3-fold in the second milking and increased further in the fourth and sixth milkings. The mean iron-binding activity increased 1.2-fold from the first to the second milkings and then decreased 3.6-fold through the sixth milking. Cows immunized with adjuvant alone showed similar responses. Per unit volume, the milk contained approximately 150 times less lysozyme than whole human saliva obtained from six subjects but higher concentrations of lactoperoxidase and iron-binding components. Purified bovine nonspecific factors prevented the growth of the bacteria used for immunization when bacteria were tested at concentrations similar to those found in saliva and milk. Because bovine nonspecific antibacterial factors could influence both the pathogenic target bacteria and the indigenous microflora in oral passive immunization studies with bovine immunoglobulins, the presence of these proteins should be considered.
TI  - Comparative bacteriological studies on summer mastitis in grazing cattle and pyogenes mastitis in stabled cattle in Denmark.
AB  - A total of 143 secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis (SM) in grazing  cattle and from 89 cases of pyogenes mastitis (PM) in stabled cattle were examined bacteriologically. The typical bacteriological finding was a mixed flora in which the predominant organisms were Actinomyces pyogenes (SM-70%, PM-85%), Peptostreptococcus indolicus (54%, 54%), a microaerophilic coccus (Stuart-Schwan coccus) (26%, 25%), Fusobacterium necrophorum biovar B (22%, 12%), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (20%, 9%) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (21%, 5%). All except six cases occurred in non-lactating animals or within three weeks after parturition. The majority of animals (about 90%) had only one quarter affected and no differences in quarter distribution were observed between the two groups.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin RP 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and RP 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included for oral streptococci). All compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. Clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against Gram-positive anaerobes, including Actinomyces spp., Propionibacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium dentium. Azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. In general, RP 59500 had higher MICs than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against Peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at 2 mg/L. Azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the Gram-negative anaerobes: Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Wolinella spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Selenomonas spp. and Mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. Clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most Gram-negative species, but was superior against Capnocytophaga ochraceus and Eikenella corrodens. RP 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most Gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against Fusobacterium spp. and Leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were moderately resistant to erythromycin. The macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas RP 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. The in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. RP 59500 showed useful activity against Gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
TI  - Successful treatment of feline pyothorax associated with an Actinomyces species and Bacteroides melanogenicus.
AB  - A cat was presented to a veterinary clinic with a severe pleural effusion from which an organism later identified as an Actinomyces spp., probably A. odontolyticus, was isolated along with Bacteroides melanogenicus. It was successfully treated with surgical drainage and a combination of amoxycillin and sulphadiazine/trimethoprim. The fluid was cytologically examined to obtain a provisional diagnosis and to allow treatment to be initiated while the organisms were cultured and identified. The cat is now clinically normal except for slight abdominal respiration, presumably resulting from adhesions following the severe infection.
TI  - Microbiologic and pathologic aspects of pulpal and periapical disease.
AB  - The greatest cause of endodontic and periapical pathosis is microbial infection of the pulp. Most odontogenic infections are of a polymicrobial nature. With advances in anaerobic isolation and culturing techniques, much has been learned about the presence of pathogenic organisms such as Porphyromonas and Prevotella species (formerly classified as black-pigmented Bacteroides species) in infected root canals. This review provides a summary of recent developments in endodontic microbiology, virulence factors, and host defense systems as they relate to the pathogenesis of pulpal and periapical inflammatory lesions.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  - The bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. Predisposing conditions were present in all instances. Sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. The abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients. There were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 Bacteroides fragilis group), Fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and Prevotella sp. and Actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). A total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 Gram-positive cocci and 6 Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - Serum IgG reactive with oral anaerobic microorganisms associated with infections  of endodontic origin.
AB  - Numerous species of bacteria have been implicated with infections of endodontic origin. The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibodies reactive with a panel of 10 oral anaerobic microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Serum samples were collected from 4 patient groups that included healthy patients without endodontic or periodontal disease, patients with chronic adult periodontal disease, patients with endodontic disease and patients with combined endodontic-periodontal disease. When Prevotella intermedia was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and each of the other 3 groups. In addition, there was a significant difference between the periodontal disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. When Porphyromonas gingivalis was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and the periodontal disease group, the healthy group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group, the endodontic disease group and the periodontal disease group and the endodontic disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. The results of this investigation support other studies that associate P. intermedia with both endodontic disease and chronic adult periodontal disease. The results also support studies that implicate P. gingivalis as a periodontopathogen.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Microbial etiology of periodontal diseases. Where are we? Where are we going?
AB  - Many studies indicate a strong association of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with localized juvenile periodontitis. Species associated with adult periodontitis include Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and Wolinella recta. Capnocytophaga species may be important in pubertal gingivitis. An unnamed spirochete related to Treponema pallidum has been identified in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis lesions. Species isolated from prepubertal periodontitis, peri-implantitis, pericoronitis, and human immunodeficiency virus gingivitis and periodontitis are similar to those isolated from periodontal and gingival infections. Species identification in combination with clinical characteristics facilitates periodontal diagnosis. DNA probes, immunoassays, and benzoyl-arginine naphthylamide reactivity methods can be used to indicate putative pathogens in plaque samples. Microbial identification aids in antibiotic selection and planning a treatment regimen.
TI  - Minocycline slow-release formulation effect on subgingival bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological efficacy of an adjunctive minocycline periodontal formulation delivered subgingivally. Subjects were systemically healthy but exhibited severe periodontitis; i.e., probing depths greater than 6 mm. The two study groups included individuals who received minocycline or a placebo periodontal formulation after root planing. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline; prior to treatment; and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Plaque was evaluated by darkfield microscopy and further analyzed for total dark-pigmented Bacteroides species, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis and Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eikenella, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, and Fusobacterium species using cultivable flora techniques. In addition, plaque was evaluated for yeast on a selective agar medium. When compared to the placebo, the minocycline group had significantly lower proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months and lower proportions of motile rods at 3 months. Furthermore, when compared to the placebo group, the minocycline patients had lower mean proportions of dark-pigmented Bacteroides spp. and P. intermedia at 1 and 3 months as well as lower proportions of E. corrodens at 1 month. The minocycline group had significant decreases in proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months, motile rods at 1 and 3 months, and increases in cocci at 1, 3, and 6 months when compared to baseline. In the placebo group, root planing was also effective at decreasing spirochetes at 1, 3, and 6 months, but with significant differences seen only at 3 and 6 months. However, the degree of reduction in spirochete proportions was greater in the minocycline group when compared with the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro hydrogen production by enteric bacteria cultured from children with small bowel bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - Lactulose breath hydrogen test and Enterotest string test were carried out simultaneously on 19 children 3-5 years old. Bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluid in upper small intestines of these children were incubated with lactulose at neutral pH. Anaerobes were present in all but one child, and in 15 children they were present in numbers greater than 5 log10 organisms per ml. Most of these bacteria did not produce hydrogen in vitro. Hydrogen production (greater than 100 ppm) was observed with the following bacteria: Bacteroides (5%), clostridia (8%), anaerobic corynebacteria (5%), Escherichia coli (67%), Lactobacillus (8%), Staphylococcus (8%), and Streptococcus (9%). The following bacteria did not produce hydrogen in vitro: Actinobacter, Actinomyces, anaerobic cocci, Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, micrococci, Neisseria, Sarcina, and Veillonella. This study suggests that in the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth using lactulose breath hydrogen test, it is important to consider that patients with a flat breath hydrogen response to a carbohydrate challenge during the first 60 min may be infected with enteric bacteria which are not capable of producing H2.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Summer mastitis in heifers: studies on the seasonal occurrence of Actinomyces pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus indolicus and Bacteroidaceae in clinically healthy cattle in Denmark.
AB  - With the aim of investigating the seasonal occurrence of Actinomyces pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii and Fusobacterium necrophorum, and thus the potential for development of summer mastitis, clinically healthy Danish Holstein-Friesian heifers due to calve in the autumn were sampled from the teat tip, the conjunctiva and the oral cavity at 2-6 week intervals from 1979 to 1981. The overall isolation rates of F. necrophorum, P. indolicus and B. melaninogenicus ss. levii, in order of significance, were significantly higher during the pasture period whereas no differences in isolation rates of A. pyogenes between housed and pastured animals were detected. F. necrophorum was recovered almost exclusively from the oral cavity, P. indolicus and A. pyogenes occurred most frequently in samples from the teat skin, whereas isolates of B. melaninogenicus ss. levii were evenly distributed between conjunctiva and teat tip samples. A distinct seasonal pattern of the isolation rates of summer mastitis pathogens was recorded, which corresponded closely to the seasonal activity of symbovine insects, in particular the headfly Hydrotaea irritans (Fallen). However, the high proportion of clinically healthy bacterial carriers as compared with the incidence of clinical disease strongly suggests that as yet unknown contributing or triggering factors, apart from the mere presence of the relevant bacterial species, are required for the establishment and development of clinical summer mastitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic comparisons of two dental implant systems.
AB  - Clinical soft tissue examination and microbiologic findings were compared for two dental implant systems. Of 20 edentulous patients, ten had been reconstructed with a transosteal implant of gold alloy, TMI-system (Bosker), of and ten with endosseous implants of titanium (Branemark-system). Clinical parameters evaluated included plaque, gingivitis, sulcus depth and bleeding on probing. Plaque samples from 14 patients were cultured for selected periodontal pathogens. Although some differences in soft tissue clinical behavior were identified, the incidence and prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens appeared to be similar.
TI  - Predominant obligate anaerobes in human periodontal pockets.
AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the predominant anaerobic bacteria of periodontal pockets in patients with advanced periodontitis, who had no previous treatment other than supragingival scaling, no history of recent or chronic systemic illness, nor any intake of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to bacteriological sampling. Care was taken not to ignore tiny-colony-forming anaerobes, by means of a stereoscope and an anaerobic glove box system. Out of 422 (100%) isolates, 380 (90%) were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that the environment in periodontal pockets was anaerobic and favors the growth of obligate anaerobes. Among the 380 obligate anaerobes isolated, strains belonging to Eubacterium (54%) were predominant, and many of them occurred in tiny colonies. The other obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to Wolinella (9%), unidentified motile rods which resemble Wolinella (7%), Peptostreptococcus (6%), Fusobacterium (5%), Bacteroides (2%; including those reclassified to Prevotella and Porphyromonas) and Selenomonas (0.5%). Among the isolates, 67% were Gram-positive bacteria, including 59% of rods (mostly asaccharolytic Eubacterium), suggesting that these bacteria, particularly strains of the Eubacterium species, may play an important role in etiology of adult periodontitis.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - The effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, Listerine Antiseptic (thymol), Peridex (chlorhexidine), Perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. At the baseline examination, papillary bleeding score (PBS), and plaque index (PI) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. Subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. At day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. Statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the 4 groups, followed by Duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. At baseline, average PBS and PI scores were similar for all 4 groups. After 14 days, the average PBS for Peridex and Perimed was significantly lower than for Listerine Antiseptic and water. The frequency of interdental units with a PBS greater than 2 was significantly lower for Peridex and Perimed than for Listerine Antiseptic and water. We concluded that both Peridex and Perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. In vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with Perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. The metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. These metals were selected because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. The bacteria selected for this study included isolates of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaniogenica, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5 percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. Cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals. Tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees C and then assayed for ATP content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. The results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. The rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.
TI  - Effects of ascorbic acid depletion and supplementation on periodontal health and  subgingival microflora in humans.
AB  - This study describes the relationship between varying ascorbate intake, periodontal status, and subgingival microflora as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of ascorbic acid (AA) metabolism in young men housed for 13 weeks in a nutrition suite that provided controlled periods of ascorbic acid depletion and repletion. Twelve medically healthy non-smoking men, aged 25 to 43 years, ate a rotating four-day diet adequate in all nutrients except ascorbic acid. Following an initial baseline period during which the subjects received 250 mg AA/day, the subjects received 5 mg AA/day for a 32-day depletion period. Eight of the 12 subjects participated in a subsequent 56-day repletion period designed to replace the reduced body AA pool slowly. Plasma and leukocyte ascorbate levels, Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing depths, and attachment level were monitored at the beginning and end of the depletion and repletion periods. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained and examined for selected organisms by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. A uniform oral hygiene program was reinforced after each examination. Ascorbate concentrations in plasma and leukocytes responded rapidly to changes in vitamin C intake. There were no significant changes in plaque accumulation, probing pocket depth, or attachment level during the study. In contrast, gingival bleeding increased significantly after the period of AA depletion and returned to baseline values after the period of AA repletion. However, no relationship could be demonstrated between either the presence or proportion of target periodontal micro-organisms and measures of bleeding or ascorbate levels.
TI  - [Etiopathogenesis of periapical lesions].
AB  - In recent years, considerable interest has been generated in the role of bacteria in causing periapical pathogenesis. This article reviews and correlates clinical and laboratory research bearing on this important topic. Bacteria in dental root canals play a decisive role in the development of periapical lesions and some of them have the ability to establish themselves in periapical tissue. Multiple mechanisms are involved: they include also immunological responses.
TI  - [Effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  - The results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. In the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella and Actinomyces. Significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. There was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). Antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine used locally showed satisfactory results. The above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: Bacillus coagulans, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Studies on the possible role of cattle nuisance flies, especially Hydrotaea irritans, in the transmission of summer mastitis in Denmark.
AB  - The summer mastitis pathogens Actinomyces pyogenes, Peptococcus indolicus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans Hydrotaea irritans (Fallen) and Morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species Haematobia irritans (L.), Haematobosca stimulans (Meigen), Culicoides sp. and Simulium sp. Secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation. Taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of Hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. In the present study the survival of A.pyogenes and P.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected Hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. However, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by Hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.
TI  - Evidence that Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis fimbriae function in adhesion to Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis adheres to gram-positive bacteria, such as Actinomyces viscosus, when colonizing the tooth surface. However, little is known of the adhesins responsible for this interaction. A series of experiments were performed to determine whether P. gingivalis fimbriae function in its coadhesion with A. viscosus. Fimbriae typical of P. gingivalis were isolated from strain 2561 (ATCC 33277) by the method of Yoshimura et al. (F. Yoshimura, K. Takahashi, Y. Nodasaka, and T. Suzuki, J. Bacteriol. 160:949-957, 1984) in fractions enriched with a 40-kDa subunit, the fimbrillin monomer, P. gingivalis-A. viscosus coaggregation was inhibited by purified rabbit antifimbrial immunoglobulin G (IgG) at dilutions eightfold higher than those of preimmune IgG, providing indirect evidence implicating P. gingivalis fimbriae in coadhesion. Three types of direct binding assays further supported this observation. (i) Mixtures of isolated P. gingivalis fimbriae and A. viscosus WVU627 cells were incubated for 1 h, washed vigorously with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), and subjected to electrophoresis. Transblots onto nitrocellulose were probed with antifimbrial antiserum. Fimbrillin labeled positively on these blots. No reaction occurred with the control protein, porcine serum albumin, when blots were exposed to anti-porcine serum albumin, (ii) A. viscosus cells incubated with P. gingivalis fimbriae were agglutinated only after the addition of antifimbrial antibodies. (iii) Binding curves generated from an enzyme immunoassay demonstrated concentration-dependent binding of P. gingivalis fimbriae to A. viscosus cells. From these lines of evidence, P. gingivalis fimbriae appear to be capable of binding to A. viscosus and mediating the coadhesion of these species.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  - Ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. In addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. Fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. The most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, black-pigmented Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented Bacteroides, Veillonella, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans. Of the 50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. This study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.

TI  - The comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. Canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides gingivalis or Bacteroides fragilis. After treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. All test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. The combined data for Pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for S. mutans and B. gingivalis or B. fragilis but showed no difference for A. viscosus.
TI  - Isolation and purification of bacteriocin from Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius).
AB  - Thirty-three out of 46 strains of Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. Thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611. An inhibition factor from one of the isolates, P. intermedia TH14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. Bacteriocin TH14 activity was effective against only P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including P. intermedia ATCC 33563, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis), Capnocytophaga sputigena and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin TH14. Bacteriocin TH14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain ATCC 25611 in 15 minutes. The growth inhibition of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 by bacteriocin TH14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of stannous fluoride and other commonly used antimicrobial agents on oral bacteria.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of stannous fluoride (SnF2) gel and other commonly used oral antimicrobial agents/products. The antibacterial inhibitory effect of the various agents was evaluated by their effect against oral plaque bacteria including strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius. A lawn of the specific bacteria to be tested was placed onto blood agar plates. Wells were then punched into the agar and each well was filled with 75 microliters of one of the antimicrobial products or control solutions. A positive control was a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution and a negative control was physiological saline. Agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees C for 5-7 days. Zones of inhibition in the lawn of bacteria were measured by a boley gauge. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and mean zones of bacterial inhibition were determined. Only 0.4% SnF2 and 0.12% chlorhexidine were consistently more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria when compared with other commercial mouth rinses/agents which had any one of a variety of antimicrobial agents as ingredients (alpha = 0.05). This in vitro study demonstrates that stannous fluoride gel is as effective as chlorhexidine in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in dental plaque.
TI  - Reactivity of IgG from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  - The presence of IgG in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. The purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of IgG from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of IgG in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. The percentages of reactivity by dot-ELISA follow: Bacteroides intermedius (84%), B. buccae (12%), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), P. endodontalis (58%), P. asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus micros (44%), P. anaerobius (26%), Eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and Actinomyces israelii (6%). At least one of the three species of B. intermedius, P. gingivalis, or P. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-ELISA with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. A lack of cross reactivity of IgG in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented Bacteroides/Porphyromonas by dot-ELISA.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the uterus of cows after calving on two hygienically contrasting farms.
AB  - Intrauterine swabs were obtained from cows after calving on two commercial dairy  herds with contrasting hygienic environments and incidence of leucorrhea, and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Of 26 cows with a normal calving and puerperium, eight of 14 (57 per cent) were sterile on farm B where hygiene was poor, compared with five of 12 (42 per cent) on farm A where hygiene was better. Two cows on farm B retained their placentas and subsequently developed metritis/endometritis. Actinomyces pyogenes was the commonest bacterial isolate and Fusobacterium nucleatum, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were also frequently observed. Similar isolates were obtained from cows on farm B with parturient or puerperal disorders. The contrasting hygienic environments had no influence on either the quantitative or qualitative uterine bacterial flora. Thus, the difference in the incidence of endometritis must have been due to factors other than hygiene.
TI  - Topical application of doxycycline on periodontally involved root surfaces in vitro: comparative analysis of substantivity on cementum and dentin.
AB  - In this study, substantivity of topically applied doxycycline hydrochloride on root surfaces obtained from patients with periodontal disease was studied in vitro. Cementum and dentin specimens were impregnated with aqueous solutions of doxycycline for 3 minutes, and incubated in serum for 10 minutes, 7 days, and 14 days. Substantivity was determined by agar diffusion inhibition assay. Comparative analyses of cementum versus dentin groups were conducted with 2-way analysis of variance. Results indicated that there was no statistically significant differences between the binding potential of doxycycline to cementum and dentin specimens. Antibacterial effect of specimens treated with the concentration of 100 mg/ml persisted for 14 days, indicating the presence of doxycycline in biologically active form. Our findings demonstrate the long lasting substantivity of doxycycline hydrochloride on periodontally diseased root surfaces and supports the concept of using root surfaces as a substrate for the deposition and slow release for local tetracycline delivery.
TI  - Specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions.
AB  - Various classes of immunoglobulins have been found in human periapical lesions. The specificity of secreted antibodies against antigens egressing from the root canal system has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to test the specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions. Human periapical biopsies were removed and cultured as organ culture explants. Antibodies present in the lesions were extracted in the cell culture fluids. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the presence, type, and concentration of different classes of antibodies against a number of commonly found bacterial species present in the root canal system. The data show the presence of specific antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) against all 16 microorganisms tested. Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces israelii, Staphylococcus intermedius, and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced significantly high levels of IgG antibodies in these lesions.
TI  - Bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in Sweden.
AB  - Bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in Sweden. Streptococci, e.g. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. Bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). When the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, May 15 to October 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). These figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. Whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of A. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. There were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas Str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. This and other Swedish investigations support the theory that A. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on Str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. It is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - It had already been shown with a single virulent strain (A42) of Fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. The present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include Bacillus subtilis, 'Bacteroides melaninogenicus', Clostridium sporogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Proteus mirabilis. The study also showed that five further virulent strains of F. necrophorum closely resembled A42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by Escherichia coli. Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and S. aureus. One further strain (A6) of F. necrophorum resembled A42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus and K. oxytoca but differed from it and the other five strains in being only slightly affected by E. coli. This work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of F. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
TI  - Adhesion of Actinomyces viscosus to Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis-coated hexadecane droplets.
AB  - Interbacterial adhesion (coadhesion) is considered a major determinant of dental  plaque ecology. In this report, we studied several aspects of the adhesion of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis to hexadecane in order to use the liquid hydrocarbon as a convenient substratum for coadhesion assays. Washed suspensions of hydrophobic P. gingivalis 2561 cells were vortexed with hexadecane to yield highly stable cell-coated droplets. Kinetics of coadhesion between Actinomyces viscosus cells and P. gingivalis-coated hexadecane droplets (PCHD) was subsequently studied. Aliquots of PCHD were added to A. viscosus suspensions, and the mixtures were gently rotated. Avid adhesion of A. viscosus cells to the immobilized P. gingivalis layer could be readily measured by the decrease in turbidity in the aqueous phase, following phase separation. Despite the ability of A. viscosus cells to adsorb to hexadecane following vigorous mixing, gentle mixing did not appreciably promote adhesion to bare hexadecane. Moreover, extensive microscopic examinations revealed that A. viscosus cells adhered exclusively to the bound P. gingivalis cells rather than to exposed areas of hexadecane. Coadhesion of A. viscosus to the PCHD appeared to follow first-order kinetics, attaining 80% levels within 30 min. Electron micrographs revealed A. viscosus cells adhering to the P. gingivalis cell layer adsorbed at the hexadecane-water interface. Interestingly, P. gingivalis cells did not appear to penetrate the hexadecane. A viscosus mutants lacking type 1 or type 2 fimbriae or both were still able to bind to the PCHD. No obvious correlation was observed between relative hydrophobicity of A. viscosus strains and their binding to PCHD. However, defatted bovine serum albumin, an inhibitor of hydrophobic interactions, was the most potent inhibitor among those tested. The data suggest that this approach provides a simple, quantitative technique for studying kinetics of bacterial coadhesion which is amenable to both light and electron microscopic observation.
TI  - [Oral bacterial flora and its pathogenic potential].
AB  - The oral flora is a complex body formed by at least a hundred bacterial species which can be more or less regular residents in the oral cavity. Thanks to a developing taxonomy related to progress made in bacterial identification, these oral species can be separated into five groups based Gram staining and morphology: the Gram positive cocci group (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and related geni), the Gram negative cocci group (Neisseria, Veillonella and related geni), the Gram positive bacilli group (Corynebacterium, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Methanobrevibacter and related geni), the Gram negative bacilli group (Haemophilus, Campylobacter, Bacteroides and related geni) and finally the spirochete group (Treponema).
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - Association of proteases of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis with its adhesion to Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - P. gingivalis adheres to A. viscosus on mineral surfaces mimicking teeth. To study whether P. gingivalis proteases contribute to its binding, mutants of P. gingivalis deficient in proteases were compared with their parent strain and a P. gingivalis-type strain for their adherence to A. viscosus on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by manipulating a radio-isotope binding assay. Adherence of P. gingivalis 2561 to A. viscosus was studied by tests of the effects of incubation temperature and known inhibitors or promoters of proteases. Controls were handled by the assay run in PBS buffer at 22 degrees C. Two mutants deficient in trypsin-like protease were found to be deficient in adherence (% attachment relative to control: 3.2 +/- 0.1% and 11.2 +/- 0.4%), while a collagenase-deficient mutant had an adherence score (51.6 +/- 8.4) closer to that of the parent strain (75.6 +/- 7.2%). Heating P. gingivalis at 70 degrees C decreased its subsequent adherence at 22 degrees C by 80%. Adherence decreased by 60% when the assay was run at 4 degrees C, but increased by 70% at 37 degrees C. Reducing agents (dithiothreitol, cysteine, and mercaptoethanol) enhanced P. gingivalis adherence by 50 to 60%. Protease inhibitors (BZMD, SBTI, TPCK, TLCK, CMPS, PMSF) decreased adherence by 10 to 50%. Also, Hg2+ and Zn2+ decreased adherence by 30 to 50%, and arginine decreased it by 50%. Most of these effects on P. gingivalis adherence were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Analysis of these data suggests that P. gingivalis proteases may contribute to the cohesion of P. gingivalis and A. viscosus.
TI  - [Bacteriological study on juvenile periodontitis].
AB  - The predominant cultivable microflora of 23 pockets in 15 juvenile periodontitis  (JP) patients was studied for the first time in China using the current anaerobic methodology. Samples were taken with sterile paper points and dispersed on a vortex mixer. Then the diluted samples were plated on the non-selective blood agar plates and selective MGB medium which favors the growth of Actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans (Aa) and incubated in anaerobic chamber for 5 days. From each sample 15 or more isolated colonies were picked in sequence without selection and subcultured. The isolates were identified mainly by Schrechenberger's 4 hour rapid methods for biochemical and fermentative tests and the chromatographic analysis of acid end products using ion-chromatography. The results were as follows: 1. The microflora of healthy sulci of 7 healthy young subjects was significantly different from that in the pocket of JP patients. The predominant species in healthy sulci were Streptococcus spp and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. 2. The species increased significantly in JP patients in prevalence and proportions was Eubacterium. Other species in high proportions were Bacteroides oris, B. melaninogenicus, B. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Actinomyces meyeri, etc. 3. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the samples.
TI  - Microbiological studies of carious dentine from human teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were made from 29 extracted teeth with irreversible pulpitis to identify the predominant flora in different parts of deep carious lesions. Most isolates were Gram-positive rods, in which lactobacilli were the most frequent organisms, then other Gram-positive, non-branching rods. Gram-positive cocci were the next most common; only a low number of Streptococcus mutans was recovered. Two types of carious lesions were found, one with high numbers of lactobacilli, the other with low. In the 15 lesions with high numbers, lactobacilli constituted 91.9% of the total flora at the pulpal site and gradually decreased in number as the sampling moved away from the pulp. Strep. mutans and alpha-haemolytic streptococci were not recovered from pulpal or deep carious sites in this group. In the 14 lesions with low numbers of lactobacilli, the flora was diverse. Gram-positive cocci, anaerobic Gram-positive non-branching rods, branching rods and/or Bacteroides were the main isolates in a few of this group.
TI  - Metabolism of 1,4-dinitro-2-methylpyrrole, a mutagen formed by a sorbic acid-nitrite reaction, by intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1,4-Dinitro-2-methylpyrrole (DNMP), a mutagenic product formed by the interaction of two common food additives, sorbic acid and sodium nitrite, was transformed to 1-nitro-2-methyl-4-aminopyrrole (NMAP) by human fecal mixtures and various intestinal bacterial strains. Under anaerobic conditions the cell suspensions of Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. demonstrated the nitroreduction activity. Under aerobic conditions, only Actinomyces and Bacteroides spp. showed activity, and this was at a decreased level. In cell suspensions of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482, NAD(P)H and glucose accelerated the reduction rate, whereas dicoumarol and heat significantly inhibited the rate, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) did not affect the rate. With cell-free preparations of the same strain, reduction required NAD(P)H as a cofactor in a dose-dependent fashion and was inactivated by air and heat.
TI  - Factors in virulence expression and their role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.
AB  - The classic progression of the development of periodontitis with its associated formation of an inflammatory lesion is characterized by a highly reproducible microbiological progression of a Gram-positive microbiota to a highly pathogenic Gram-negative one. While this Gram-negative microbiota is estimated to consist of at least 300 different microbial species, it appears to consist of a very limited number of microbial species that are involved in the destruction of periodontal diseases. Among these "putative periodontopathic species" are members of the genera Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Wolinella, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, and Eikenella. While members of the genera Actinomyces and Streptococcus may not be directly involved in the microbial progression, these species do appear to be essential to the construction of the network of microbial species that comprise both the subgingival plaque matrix. The temporal fluctuation (emergence/disappearance) of members of this microbiota from the developing lesion appears to depend upon the physical interaction of the periodontal pocket inhabitants, as well as the utilization of the metabolic end-products of the respective species intimately involved in the disease progression. A concerted action of the end-products of prokaryotic metabolism and the destruction of host tissues through the action of a large number of excreted proteolytic enzymes from several of these periodontopathogens contribute directly to the periodontal disease process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of thiolactomycin against gram-negative anaerobes associated with periodontal disease. f1.
AB  - Thiolactomycin (TLM), (4R)-(2E,5E)-2,4,6-trimethyl-3-hydroxy-2,5, 7-octatriene-4-thiolide, purified from a culture filtrate of a strain of the Nocardia species, was examined for antimicrobial activities against more than 100 strains of oral and periodontally associated bacteria. Nine other commonly used antibiotics were also included for the test. We found that TLM exhibited strong and selective antimicrobial activities against Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral black-pigmented Bacteroides species that may be etiologically associated with adult periodontitis. TLM also inhibited the growth of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, but did not affect the growth of oral streptococcal species and Eubacterium species. Strains of Eikenella corrodens were moderately susceptible to TLM, while Actinomyces viscosus strains were only slightly susceptible to it. Other antibiotics used for comparison showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities in general. In conclusion, TLM exhibited highly selective antimicrobial activities to black-pigmented Bacteroides species and A. actinomycetemcomitans, both of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of human periodontal disease.
TI  - [Studies on immunobiological activities of periodontopathic bacteria. Comparison  of the activities of soluble components from Bacteroides gingivalis and Actinomyces viscosus].
AB  - It has been proposed that Bacteroides gingivalis and Actinomyces viscosus are most important agents to pathogenesis of the periodontitis and gingivitis. In this study, the influences of sonic extracts prepared from B. gingivalis and A. viscosus for DNA synthesis of murine lymphocytes, production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), collagenase and interleukin-1 (IL-1) from human peripheral monocyte were investigated. Furthermore, PGE2 and collagenase production by fibroblasts from human periodontal ligament (HPLF) and gingiva (Gin 1) stimulated with macrophage conditioned medium (MCM) cultured with bacterial sonic extracts were examined. The results obtained were as follows. 1. The sonic extracts (10 micrograms/ml protein) from B. gingivalis and A. viscosus showd low mitogenic activity to spleen cells, however, induced polyclonal B cell activation. 2. Although, the effect of these sonic extracts on the production of PGE2 and collagenase by human peripheral monocyte was not found, the induction of IL-1 production was recognized. 3. The culture supernatants of C3H/HeN mouse peritoneal macrophage stimulated with sonic extracts of B. gingivalis and A. viscosus were induced PGE2 and collagenase production by HPLF and Gin 1. These results suggest that the cellular components of B. gingivalis and A. viscosus may play the pathogenic roles in periodontal tissue destruction through the stimulation of macrophage and/or lymphocyte.
TI  - Changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. A 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  - It was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. During this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. High values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. The frequency of detection of Actinomyces odontolyticus and of Capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. The frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting Bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. However, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). A significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of A. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). In girls, a similar increase was obtained for A. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the Tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). The changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.
TI  - Microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  - In this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. During 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls 10 times. At the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI). A total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. Children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean PBI scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and Eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). The mean proportion of Actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). Among the species discriminated, only Capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of PBI (p less than = 0.05). The detection frequencies of black-pigmented Bacteroides (particularly B. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). These findings implicate Capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of Bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  - Seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (HWSM) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (BSM) and sheep (OSM), and from the stomach of pig (PGM). Considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. The aggregating activity of HWSM varied widely among the different bacterial strains. The Bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for S. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for S. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the S. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five Actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. For a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. For a human salivary mucin (MG-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence NeuAc (alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)GalNac- was specifically involved in the interaction with S. sanguis strains, in contrast to S. rattus BHT. Our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of S. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. On the other hand, desialization of BSM and OSM largely abolished their aggregating capability towards S. rattus BHT. Moreover, it was found that BSM and OSM, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of a triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice on the oral microflora.
AB  - Eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% Gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. Subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. At baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces species, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) Lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, Staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. After 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in S. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. The subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. This study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% Gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.
TI  - Evaluation of the ATB 32 A system for identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - A new miniaturized 4-h method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, ATB 32 A (API System SA, Montalieu Vercieu, France), was evaluated against conventional methods of identification. The evaluation was done by using 260 recent clinical isolates and 21 reference strains of anaerobic bacteria. All reference strains were correctly identified and did not figure in the detailed analysis. Of the 140 gram-negative bacilli, 90.6% of Bacteroides spp. and 95.5% of Fusobacterium spp. were correctly identified to the species level, with an additional 8.4% of the Bacteroides spp. being identified to the genus level. Clostridia were correctly identified in 85.9% of cases, with an additional 9.9% being identified to the genus level. Peptostreptococci were correctly identified in 91.6% of cases. The 4 strains of Actinomyces spp. were all identified correctly, as were 10 of the 11 strains of Propionibacterium spp. A total of 3.1% of strains were not identified by ATB 32 A, while for 1.9% of strains, completely false identifications were obtained. Estimation of the individual preformed enzyme results may pose problems, although these decrease with familiarity with the system. With certain enzyme profiles, additional testing was necessary to arrive at an identification; however, there was no requirement for gas-liquid chromatography. If certain additions are made to the data base and the difficulties of determination of organisms to the species level among the non-Bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) members of the B. fragilis group can be reduced, this system holds promise as a reliable standardized alternative for the identification of anaerobic bacteria in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Evaluation of the activity of four antimicrobial agents using an in vitro rapid micromethod against oral streptococci and various bacterial strains implicated in periodontitis.
AB  - The activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. The activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. Their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. Amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. Doxycycline was active against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. Josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards the strict anaerobes. The use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. For periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. This may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  - Phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus. The results revealed that Actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and Bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. The other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. Such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.
TI  - Clinical, pathologic, and microbiologic findings of foot abscess in neonatal pigs.
AB  - A longitudinal study was undertaken in a swine herd with an ever-present problem  of foot abscess in suckling pigs reared on a woven-wire floor. Of 3,322 4-day-old pigs, 199 (6%) developed abscess lesions involving claws and accessory digits before weaning. Lesions were first detected in 4-day-old pigs; median and mean ages at onset were 10 and 11.3 days, respectively. At first detection, most pigs had only a single claw affected, but 39 pigs had at least 2 claws with abscesses. Hind limbs had more affected claws (140) than forelimbs (96). In the hind limbs, medial claws were most likely to have lesions, whereas the reverse was true for the forelimbs. Gross and microscopic examinations of affected claws indicated necrotic pododermatitis, with severe osteomyelitis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis. Bacteria isolated from foot abscess lesions included Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp, Actinobacillus spp, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium spp, Bacteroides spp, and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Effect of pH on the growth and proteolytic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius.
AB  - The effect of pH on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius was investigated. B. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a pH as low as 5.0. These bacteria grew almost as well as Streptococcus mutans at pH 5.0 and better than Actinomyces viscosus at pH 5.5 and 5.0. Some B. intermedius strains raised the culture pH when grown at a low pH without glucose. In contrast, P. gingivalis strains grew only at pH 6.5 to 7.0. The P. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the B. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. B. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at pH 7.0, and high activity over a wide pH range. In contrast, the optimum pH of proteolytic activity in P. gingivalis was pH 7.5 to 8.0. The P. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of B. intermedius to low pH. The capacity of B. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low pH might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. These differences between B. intermedius and P. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how B. intermedius might positively influence the growth of P. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aggregation of Actinomyces strains by extracellular vesicles produced by Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - The aggregation of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii with extracellular vesicles of Bacteroides gingivalis was studied. Factors influencing the aggregation phenomenon were examined. L-Arginine was found to effectively inhibit aggregation as was an antibody preparation directed against a B. gingivalis surface hemagglutinin. Aggregation occurred over a wide pH range and did not seem to be affected by high salt concentrations or the presence of carbohydrates. Treatment of the vesicle preparation with proteases, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and high temperatures diminished or eliminated aggregation, while similar treatment of the Actinomyces had no effect on aggregation.
TI  - A multicentre study to evaluate the effect of sulbactam/ampicillin combination on anaerobic micro-organisms.
AB  - Ampicillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam was compared with ampicillin alone, cefoxitin and metronidazole against 569 clinical strains of anaerobic organisms. The strains included 289 species of Bacteroides, 160 strains of Clostridium and 120 strains of various species of Streptococcus/Peptostreptococus, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, Actinomyces and Propionibacterium. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as cefoxitin and metronidazole against all anaerobic species tested, inhibiting more than 90% of strains at the breakpoints (16, 32 and 32 mg/l, respectively). Sulbactam/ampicillin was also significantly more active than ampicillin against strains of Bacteroides, the minimal inhibitory concentration being at least four-fold lower. In contrast, the activity of the combination did not differ from that of ampicillin alone against Fusobacterium species and Gram-positive rods and cocci.
TI  - Selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  - The present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. Buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a model for study. Bacteria studied included Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, Actinomyces species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. Treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. Neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of S. sanguis and S. mitis studied. In contrast, the number of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii and A. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. Neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of B. intermedius and B. gingivalis. Treatment of buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. Such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and A. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius were significantly increased. Treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human PMNs produced similar selective effects. The changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.
TI  - The obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  - Samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. All mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. A mixed growth was obtained from all samples. The mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. Of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. Of the facultatively anaerobic species, Actinomyces (including A. viscosus, A. hordeovulneris and A. denticolens) comprised 12%, Pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and Propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. Clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates, Wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was C. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was P. multocida. These findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.
TI  - The microbiology of periapical granulomas.
AB  - Of the 16 periapical granulomas studied, 14 (88%) yielded a positive growth when  homogenized and cultured. The concentration of colony-forming units per milliliter of the suspension ranged from 10(1.3) to 10(4.0) (mean 10(2.2)). A total of 47 isolates comprising 26 (55%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (45%) strict anaerobes were obtained. The organisms most commonly cultured were Veillonella species (15%), Streptococcus milleri (11%), Streptococcus sanguis (11%), Actinomyces naeslundii (11%), Propionibacterium acnes (11%), and Bacteroides species (10%). Most of the organisms (96%) were sensitive to either amoxicillin, clindamycin, or tetracycline, whereas only 45% were sensitive to metronidazole.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the vagina and uterus of healthy cats.
AB  - Bacterial culturing was conducted on samples from the reproductive tracts of 53 clinically healthy female cats. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 52 of 53 vaginal swab samples and from 2 of 29 uterine swab samples. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in 4 of 30 vaginal and 1 of 29 uterine cultures. The aerobic bacteria included species of Acinetobacter, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus canis, and E coli were the most common organisms and were isolated from 56%, 52%, and 44% of the vaginal samples, respectively. Anaerobes isolated from vaginal samples included 3 species of Bacteroides and 2 isolates of Peptococcus. The single uterine anaerobe isolate was a Lactobacillus sp. The number of bacterial species isolated from each vaginal culture ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 3). The number of colony forming units tended to vary inversely with the number of bacterial species detected in each sample.
TI  - The microbial flora from root canals and periodontal pockets of non-vital teeth associated with advanced periodontitis.
AB  - Microflora from root canals and periodontal pockets of periodontally affected teeth were compared in order to elucidate the as yet unknown relationship between pulpal and periodontal disease. Caries-free teeth affected with advanced periodontitis and diagnosed as clinically dead by electric pulp testing were selected. The root canals and periodontal pockets were sampled, and the bacterial flora examined by both culture and interference microscopy. The results indicated that the aerobe/anaerobe ratio in the periodontal pocket was 0.23, while it was 0.0022 in the root canal, the large predominance of obligate anaerobes reflecting the anaerobic environment found in the root canal. Morphological classification obtained from interference microscopy showed similar proportions of morphotypes in the two sites. Results of anaerobic culture demonstrated a significantly higher rate of detection of facultative Streptococcus bacteria in the periodontal pocket than in the root canal. The predominant bacterial species common to both regions were Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium for obligate anaerobes. As for facultative anaerobes, Actinomyces and Streptococcus were detected predominantly in the periodontal pocket. The occurrence of micro-organisms common to both sites in this study suggests that the periodontal pocket may be a possible source of root canal infections.
TI  - [A microbiologic study on anaerobic bacteremia after dental extraction].
AB  - It has been known for many years that tooth extraction can cause bacterial dissemination into blood stream, that is, bacteremia. Besides endocarditis--causing bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, anaerobes are involved in the post- extraction bacteremia. They are of clinical importance because they can cause abscesses in the various parenchymatous organs such as the liver, lung, and brain through anachoresis. The purpose of this study is to establish the types of species of anaerobes associated with post--extraction bacteremia, and to give the baseline to the succeeding study of sensitivity tests of various antibiotics, thus clinicians can chose the right ones. 10ml of blood was sampled pre- and post- operatively from 32 patients and incubated in anaerobic chamber. The followings are the results of this study. 1. All the preoperative blood samples showed negative culture. 2. Postoperative blood samples from 8 out of 10 patients (80%) in group 1, from 1 out of 15 (73.3%) in group 2, and 2 out of 7 (28.6%) in group 3 yielded anaerobic and facultative species. 3. Organisms detected were species belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, Propionebacterium, Fusobacterium, nonenterococcus, and Corynebacterium.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  - Chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. The controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. The effect on the following bacteria was studied: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Wolinella recta, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. Chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. The plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. Distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. Thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
TI  - Comparison of plaque microflora between Chinese and Caucasian population groups.
AB  - This investigation was designed to compare the predominant plaque micro-organisms from a Chinese group of patients exhibiting periodontitis with an age-, sex- and periodontal disease-matched Caucasian group of patients. In addition to race, the 2 population groups differed with respect to diet and oral hygiene habits, or effectiveness at removing plaque. Clinical measurements were determined along with an evaluation for micro-organisms in supragingival and subgingival plaque. Although the Chinese and Caucasian population groups were similar with respect to composition of micro-organisms in subgingival plaque, notable differences were observed in supragingival plaque. The Chinese group had higher mean proportions of spirochetes, motile rods. Fusobacterium spp. and dark-pigmented Bacteroides species, while the Caucasian group had higher mean proportions of cocci, total Actinomyces spp., A. viscosus and total Streptococcus spp. in supragingival plaque. The microbial differences observed in supragingival plaque may be explained at least in part, if not totally, by the higher plaque index scores of the Chinese versus Caucasian population groups.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  - An in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. The assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga species, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus species, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. Approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to enamel, including the fresh isolates of B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, Veillonella species and S. sanguis. Adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. Three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. The assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.

TI  - Comparative microbiological and immunological studies of subgingival dental plaque from man and baboons.
AB  - Baboons may be useful as animal models for the study of human oral diseases and infections. They are closely related to man anatomically, physiologically, and phylogenetically. Plaque and gingival indices were relatively low in 18 baboons (Papio anubis). The mean scores ranged between 0.62 +/- 0.29 and 0.37 +/- 0.20, respectively. Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci comprised 27.0 +/- 32.4 and 3.1 +/- 7.5% of the total viable counts in the dental plaque samples. Black-pigmented Bacteroides formed about 1.9 +/- 5.9% of the bacterial population in the samples. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were found in 73.2% of the samples and averaged 19.2 +/- 26.3% of the total recovered flora. Species of the oral Actinomyces and other Gram-positive rods found in humans were not isolated. The composition of the oral flora in baboons appeared to be significantly different from that of man. Isolates of F. nucleatum, L. buccalis, and B. intermedius from the two mammals were biochemically similar, but were distinguishable by analysis with antibody, both by precipitin lines and/or differences between homologous and heterologous titers.
TI  - [Significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. Qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  - In the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. As a matter of fact it has been proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. Infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). On the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. Only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved. In endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. The most frequently found obligate anaerobes are Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. (Gram- rods) Anaerobic Diphtheroides (Gram+ rods) Peptostreptococcus sp. (Gram+ cocci) and Veilonella sp. (Gram- cocci). Actinomyces sp., Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.
TI  - Genetic approaches to the study of oral microflora: a review.
AB  - As the study of oral microorganisms intensified almost 2 decades ago, the application of genetic techniques resulted in important contributions to the understanding of this clinically and ecologically important group of bacteria. The isolation and characterization of mutants of cariogenic streptococci helped to focus attention on traits that were important in colonization and virulence. Such classic genetic approaches gave way to molecular genetic techniques, including recombinant DNA methodology in the late 1970s. Gene cloning systems and methods to move DNA into cells have been developed for oral streptococci. Many streptococcal genes thought to be important in colonization and virulence have since been cloned and their nucleotide sequence determined. Mutant strains have been constructed using defective copies of cloned genes in order to create specific genetic lesions on the bacterial chromosome. By testing such mutants in animal models, a picture of the cellular and molecular basis of dental caries is beginning to emerge. These modern genetic methodologies also are being employed to develop novel and efficacious cell-free or whole cell vaccines against this infection. Genetic approaches and analyses are now being used to dissect microorganisms important in periodontal disease as well. Such systems should be able to exploit advances made in genetically manipulating related anaerobes, such as the intestinal Bacteroides. Gene cloning techniques in oral anaerobes, Actinomyces and Actinobacillus, are already beginning to pay dividends in helping understand gene structure and expression. Additional effort is needed to develop facile systems for genetic manipulation of these important groups of microorganisms.
TI  - [Antibody titer in saliva and serum of experimental animals].
AB  - This paper reveals the antibody titer of plaque microorganisms in experimental gingivitis rats of differents ages and immunization. Before sacrificing experimental animals status of gingival tissue was assessed. Further on speciments of saliva and serum were taken for antibody titer measurements. None of the young rats developed gingivitis during experiment, where as the adult immunized rats bled on probing. Low values of antibodys point out the absence of intensive synthesis of specific antibodys in saliva upon the antigen stimulation of plaque maicroorganisms. Serum antibody titers were low in young rats, moderate in adult, and high in adult immunized rats. These results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigents than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.
TI  - The immediate efficacy of adjunctive doxycycline in treatment of localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of doxycycline (100 mg for 14 days) was carried out to determine the benefit of adjunctive medication in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. Measurements of gingival fluid flow, probing depths, bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss, at weeks 0, 1, 3 and 8. Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites. Spirochaetes were searched for by dark-field microscopy. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pigmented and non-pigmented Bacteroides spp., Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp. were cultured on various selective and non-selective media. Bacterial species found at least in 50% of the patients and comprising on average 5% or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis. Neither short-term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of mechanical debridement alone was found by using systemic medication with doxycycline in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.
TI  - Role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  - Progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may frequently be involved. Such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. Hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. Adhesins of Actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in solution. Cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. Thus, several bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii and Bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase. Similarly, the adhesion of some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. It seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.
TI  - Sensitivity of oral bacteria to imipenem and other antibiotics.
AB  - Specimens from a variety of oral and maxillofacial infections were cultured and 88 bacterial isolates belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Veillonella, Eubacterium, Streptococcus and Aerococcus were obtained. These were tested for their sensitivity to imipenem, penicillin, cefuroxime, vancomycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid. Imipenem proved to be the most effective of the antibiotics tested, inhibiting all 88 isolates. Penicillin was the least effective in that it inhibited only 56% of the isolates.
TI  - Glucanase-producing organisms in human dental plaques.
AB  - Selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. Glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran- and starch-containing media. All sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. The glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. Of these 38% were Gram-positive rods, 27% Gram-positive cocci, 28% Gram-negative rods and 7% were Gram-negative cocci. The cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were Actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and Gram-negative anaerobes. Species prominent among these isolates included Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Bifidobacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp. No isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as Streptococcus milleri, Rothia dentocariosa or Fusobacterium sp. This study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. In order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.
TI  - Effects of periodontopathic bacteria on IL-1 and IL-1 inhibitor production by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - The effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and an IL-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's) was examined. Peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the PMN's were separated using dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The PMN's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. Four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; Bacteroides gingivalis FDC 381, Bacteroides forsythus FDC 338, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and Fusobacterium nucleatum FDC 263. The non-oral Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 was used as a control organism. IL-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. The non-oral organism F. mortiferum stimulated IL-1 production by PMN's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated IL-1 release although the bacteria themselves had an IL-1 enhancing effect. Following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated PMN supernatants, an IL-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. These results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of PMN's and may also suggest a regulatory role for PMN's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.
TI  - Bacteroides loeschei PK1295 cells express two distinct adhesins simultaneously.
AB  - Bacteroides loeschei synthesizes two distinct adhesins that mediate its coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israeli PK14. Streptococcal adhesin-specific and actinomyces adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to prepare antibody-coated 5- or 10-nm gold particles. These were used in immunoelectron microscopic studies to establish that essentially all bacteroides cells in a population express both adhesins. In general, the two sizes of gold particles representing each type of adhesin appeared to be spatially separated on neighboring fimbriae of B. loeschei. Deposition of antibody-coated gold particles, representing both types of adhesin, at or near the same fimbria was observed less frequently.
TI  - [Effect of systemic oral administration of tetracycline on experimental gingivitis in golden hamsters].
AB  - Local and systemic administrations of tetracycline have been used in human periodontal treatment for conditions including juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis, although microbiological effects of the treatment have not been clear. The effect of systemic oral administration of tetracycline on subgingival bacteria in experimental periodontal disease in hamsters as an animal model has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival bacteria and bone resorption at the lower left first molar, and supragingival plaque formation on the lower right first molar in animals with (TC group) or without (Diet-2000 group) systemic oral administration of tetracycline hydrochloride 25 mg/kg/day in 20-day-old golden hamsters that mere fed a high sucrose diet (Diet-2000). Experimental periods were established as 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71 days. Supragingival plaque formation on the lingual surface on the lower right first molar in the Diet-2000 group gradually increased with time; that in the TC group was scarce and was not increased with time. Bone resorption at the lower left first molar in the Diet-2000 group proceeded rapidly with time, while that in the TC group was scarce. Total number of bacteria from subgingival plaque on the lower left first molar in the Diet-2000 group increased rapidly with time, but that in the TC group did not vary at all with time. Actinomyces (Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus) and Bacteroides (Bacteroides capillosus and Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. ruminicola) in the Diet-2000 group increased with time; those in the TC group decreased with time. A remarkable difference in IgG titers to Bacteroides asaccharolyticus was not observed in the Diet-2000 and the TC groups. These results suggest that systemic oral administration of tetracycline hydrochloride on experimental gingivitis in golden hamsters causes the total number of subgingival bacteria to be confined, and to be decreased species of Actinomyces (Actinomyces naeslundii and Acinomyces viscosus) and Bacteroides (Bacteroides capillosus and Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. ruminicola), leading to the inhibition of bone resorption and supragingival plaque formation. It is suggested that Bacteroides asaccharolyticus is not a pathogen concerned in experimental periodontal disease in hamsters, because the antibody titer was not elevated in the Diet-2000 group.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of gingivitis in pubertal children. 2. Subgingival microflora cultivable on the nonselective blood agar medium].
AB  - The present study involved cultural and microscopic characterization of the subgingival microorganisms of pubertal children with gingivitis. Samples were obtained from eight children 12-14 years of age. Gram-positive organisms made up 56% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25% of the isolates and Bacteroides intermedius (9.7%) was most predominant species. The selective media permitted significantly lower recovery of Actinomyces spp. and Capnocytophaga spp. than nonselective blood agar medium. However, sixty-nine percents of isolates were cultured on the selective media employed in the present study. These results suggest that the subgingival microflora of gingivitis in pubertal children may be similar to those of adult gingivitis and that the use of these six selective media makes it possible to enumerate predominant cultivable microorganisms in subgingival area of pubertal children with gingivitis.
TI  - Capacity of anaerobic bacteria enclosed in a simulated root canal to induce inflammation.
AB  - In an effort to simulate the infected dental root canal, bacteria were enclosed in polyethylene tubes that were subcutaneously implanted into rats. Four different bacterial combinations, selected from nine oral species, were tested. The contents of 144 inoculated and implanted 'root canals' were analysed after 2 and 4 weeks of implantation. Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Fusobacterium were inoculated in low numbers but dominated the mixed flora at the end of the experiment. The bacteria-filled tubes induced inflammation of the rat tissue at the implant opening ('foramen'). It is confirmed that mixed bacterial populations survive, show succession and develop within an enclosed environment. Such florae cause significant inflammation at the interface with the host tissues.
TI  - Increased periodontal bone loss in temporarily B lymphocyte-deficient rats.
AB  - In order to study the role of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in the development  of marginal periodontitis, experiments were performed on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) rats with various immunologic profiles. The study comprised nude (congenitally T lymphocyte-deficient), thymus-grafted nude (T-lymphocyte reconstituted), anti-mu treated (temporarily B lymphocyte-deficient), and normal rats. When they were 5 to 9 weeks old, some of the rats were inoculated with Actinomyces viscosus. Bacteroides gingivalis and a strain of oral spirochetes; 90 days later they were killed. A. viscosus and B. gingivalis colonized readily, but the spirochete strain could not be established permanently in the oral cavity of the rats, 95% of the inoculated rats raised serum IgG or IgM antibody against one or more of the microorganisms; nude rats tended to raise less antibody than the three other experimental groups. Inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than controls. Anti-mu treated inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than nude and normal rats, whereas no difference was found between normal, nude, and thymus-grafted rats. It is concluded that permanent T-lymphocyte deficiency did not interfere with the development of periodontal disease in this model, whereas a temporary and moderate reduction in B-lymphocyte numbers seemed to predispose for aggravation of periodontal bone loss.
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - Effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine on bacterial recolonization following periodontal surgery.
AB  - Bacterial plaque accumulation following periodontal surgery has been directly associated with delayed and altered surgical wound healing. Successful antimicrobial treatment following periodontal surgery depends upon the elimination and suppression of wound associated microorganisms. Highly effective antimicrobials should also prevent recolonization of periodontopathogens. In this investigation, the antimicrobial effect of a 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse (Peridex) on bacterial recolonization after periodontal surgery was determined. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out on 40 patients for 6 weeks. Patients with moderate periodontitis (AAP Class III) underwent osseous periodontal flap surgery in one quadrant. Subgingival and marginal plaque samples from the surgery area were taken prior to surgery and 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. General descriptive bacteriological cultural analysis and assays for specific microbial populations were carried out. During the 6 weeks of mouthrinse use, patients using chlorhexidine had significant reductions over placebo (P less than 0.05) in the number of total Gram-positive facultative cocci, streptococci (85.8%); Gram-positive facultative rods, primarily Actinomyces (91.7%); Capnocytophaga (97.6%) and Gram-negative anaerobic rods (94.5%). Few black pigmented Bacteroides or Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found prior to surgery or any time postoperatively. In the chlorhexidine group, 6 weeks post surgery, streptococci were the predominant bacterial group in the sampled plaque. Quantitatively, the distribution of bacteria, after 2 and 6 weeks of mouthrinse use, was consistent with a young, less mature plaque. A previous study demonstrated that this plaque was associated with clinical health.
TI  - [Microbiological changes in subgingival flora after treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid].
AB  - The association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be employed as an alternative to  the usual antibiotic therapy of periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to determine subgingival microbial changes in 33 patients with periodontitis after using amoxicillin (500 mgrs.-t.i.d.) and clavulanic acid (125 mgrs.-t.i.d.) for 5 days. It resulted clinically in a decrease of both gingival index and plaque index (not significant) and microbiologically in absence of the main bacterial pathogens found pretreatment, such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces sp., although it was not able to eliminate Actinobacillus asinomycetemcomitans from a juvenile periodontitis and from a prepuberal periodontitis patient. Atibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all bacteria tested were sensitive to this antibiotic. Although this short term study shows good microbial response of main periodontal pathogens, long term studies are necessary to assess the effect of this antibiotic in periodontitis therapy.
TI  - [Chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. Murine peritoneal PMN was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. The PMN response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the CL response were also measured. The bacteria which could induce a high level of CL response of PMN were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were Staphylococcus subsp. and Actinomyces subsp.; low levels were Lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of Streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Phagocytic indexes of PMN to various kind of bacteria were distributed from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 PMN were 27 to 301. There was no correlation between CL values and phagocytic indexes or between CL values and the bacterial number in 100 PMN by limiting the data on Staphylococcus, Streptococcus subsp. and Lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. There was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from PMN by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of PMN. Either catalase activities or SOD activities were measured by H2O2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. Neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of CL response.
TI  - Fimbria-associated adhesin of Bacteroides loeschei that recognizes receptors on procaryotic and eucaryotic cells.
AB  - Inhibition studies with a set of adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies and various sugars revealed that a fimbria-associated adhesin of Bacteroides loeschei recognizes receptors on both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. These interactions permit this bacterium to attach to both types of cells, producing coaggregates in the presence of strains of Streptococcus sanguis and hemagglutination in the presence of neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes.
TI  - Relative adherence of Bacteroides species and strains to Actinomyces viscosus on  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The study was designed to compare the adherence of several Bacteroides species to A. viscosus. Using 3H, we labeled 24 laboratory strains, including 13 Bacteroides species and 11 fresh clinical isolates of three Bacteroides species. Their adherence to A. viscosus bound to a saliva-coated mineral surface was quantified by liquid scintillation. Adherence relative to a standard strain, B. gingivalis 2561, was compared. Among the lab bacteroides, those of B. gingivalis (eight strains) were the greatest binders (mean, 80.5 +/- 12.4%). Strains of other lab bacteroides bound less well (mean, 33.4 +/- 6.3%). The difference in means was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The mean for B. gingivalis strains was also significantly greater than that for strains of B. intermedius (51.7 +/- 6.2%). Attachment of B. gingivalis was saturable in experiments in which either input concentration or time was the independent variable, indicating that B. gingivalis cells do not accumulate in this vitro simulation of plaque formation by binding to each other. Subculture did not seem to affect the degree of binding.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant effects of periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  - Sonic extract (SE) from periodontopathic bacteria were studied for their effects  on the immune response and adjuvanticity. The preparations of SE from A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius and B. gingivalis were found to have strong immunomodulating activity against the antigen itself and also sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) in in vivo experiments using C3H/HeN mice. All the SE enhanced the immune response to antigen and SRBC at low concentration. A strong immuno suppressive effect, however, was found at high concentrations of A. actinomycetemcomitans and B. intermedius but not of B. gingivalis. Moreover, these immunosuppressive effects were enhanced by the 3-day-prior injection to SRBC even at low concentrations, including that of B. gingivalis. The suppressive effect of SE from A. actinomycetemcomitans was dependent on the protein fraction in the SE tested, because suppressed anti-SRBC immune response was restored by pronase treatment or heating. Failure to recover immune response, found in a similar experiment using Bacteroides intermedius, indicated that its suppressive effect was due to a heat-stable and pronase-resistant substance. These findings, along with the data presented in this paper, support the hypothesis that patients who harbor these bacteria could suffer systemic immune suppression not only from the initial periodontopathic bacteria but also from secondary infecting bacteria. These suppressive effects may also enhance the pathogenicity of other opportunistic organisms in the gingival crevice.
TI  - Influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  - To study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides gingivalis. On days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. The rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. None of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. In general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. These results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of natural substances on oral bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of natural substances was investigated in vitro against  oral bacteria including Streptococcus sp., Actinomyces sp., Actinobacillus sp., Bacteroides sp., Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella sp., Fusobacterium sp. and Propionibacterium sp. Among the natural substances tested, hinokitiol was the most inhibitory to oral bacteria. Cinnamon bark oil, papua-mace extracts, and clove bud oil in spice extracts were also inhibitory against many oral bacteria. Egg white lysozyme exhibited antimicrobial action against the periodontitis associated bacteria.
TI  - Effect of periodontal status of rotary electric toothbrushes vs. manual toothbrushes during periodontal maintenance. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - We compared the use of a rotary electric toothbrush with conventional toothbrushing for their effectiveness in modulating the subgingival microbiota. Forty subjects who had received periodontal treatment for moderate to advanced periodontitis and were on 3-month periodontal maintenance were divided into two equal groups matched for age and sex. One group used only the rotary tooth cleaner and the other group used conventional toothbrushing, dental floss, and toothpicks for 12 months. Subgingival plaque samples (two sites per patient) were taken from 10 subjects per group at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months and analyzed for percentage of obligate anaerobes and colony-forming units of black-pigmented Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Streptococcus, and Veillonella spp. The percentage of spirochetes and motile rods was determined by darkfield microscopy. Results showed that levels of obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces and percentage of spirochetes and motile rods decreased significantly (P less than 0.05), while levels of Streptococcus spp. increased (P less than 0.05) for both groups. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups, indicating that the rotary tooth cleaner and conventional toothbrushing are equally effective in controlling gingivitis and fostering a less pathogenic microflora.
TI  - Fusobacterium necrophorum and Actinomyces pyogenes associated facial and mandibular abscesses in blue duiker.
AB  - Anaerobic and aerobic cultures of facial and mandibular abscesses were made from  12 blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola fusicolor) housed at the Deer and Duiker Research Facility of the Pennsylvania State University (USA). Increases in concentrations of total protein and serum globulin occurred in all cases. Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from nine animals. Fusobacterium necrophorum was present in eight and Bacteroides sp. was found in seven animals; other genera of isolated bacteria included: Streptococcus (from two animals), Lactobacillus (one), Staphylococcus (one) and Actinomyces (two). Eight (67%) of affected animals were less than or equal to 2 yr of age. Facial soft tissues and mandibles were the tissues most often affected. Tissues within the oral cavity were not affected at the time of presentation. A common finding, not reported in other host species with necrobacillosis, was the presence of nondestructive mandibular proliferation.
TI  - [Microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  - If disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. One hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. Clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. Subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius. The levels of serum IgG antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. Thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. The clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. Active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and A. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of B. gingivalis was the highest among six bacterial species tested. A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens and F. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. The proportion of B. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. B. gingivalis and B. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of A. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. Sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to B. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to A. viscosus than those of healthy persons. Antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. After periodontal therapy, antibody levels to B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to A. viscosus increased to a slight degree. B. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. The proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. The results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring B. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum IgG antibody titer against this organism may aid in the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.
TI  - Enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - Necrobacillosis is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. Their possible role was studied in experiments made with a virulent FN strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously) were given. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN. Citrobacter freundii and comparatively small numbers of Corynebacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of E. coli. An alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of FN, though less strikingly than E. coli. FN increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and B. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.
TI  - Effect of Actinomyces pyogenes and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria on the development of bovine pyometra.
AB  - Fifteen lactating Holstein cows were used in a trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of intrauterine inoculation (challenge) of Actinomyces pyogenes (A) alone or in combination with Fusobacterium necrophorum (F) and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (B) to induce pyometra. Cows were assigned to one of five groups: A (n = 3), AB (n = 3), AF (n = 3), ABF (n = 3) or C (control, broth medium alone; n = 3). All cows exhibited estrus 12 or 13 d prior to challenge (Day 0=first day of challenge). During the prechallenge period, the reproductive tract of each cow was palpated per rectum and uterine fluid aspirates for culture and uterine biopsies were also obtained. All cows received an intravenous injection of 5,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Day 5) and an intrauterine infusion of 40 ml of 0.7% iodine solution (Day 1). Cows were then inoculated on Days 0, 1 and 2 of the experiment. Sequential palpations of the reproductive tracts, samples of uterine fluid for culture and uterine biopsies were performed for a total of 30 d after the first inoculation. A cow was diagnosed as having pyometra when purulent uterine fluid and a corpus luteum were detected by palpation per rectum. The number of cows that developed pyometra in Group A was 2 of 3, in Group AB 3 of 3, in Group AF 3 of 3, in Group ABF 3 of 3 and in Group C 0 of 3. Cows with pyometra did not exhibit estrus. In 7 of 11 cows, pyometra persisted for more than 21 d. In cows that developed pyometra, the same species of bacteria infused into the uterus were usually recovered one or more times during the postchallenge period. When clinical pyometra was diagnosed, histologic endometritis was invariably present. Histologic endometritis and concurrent isolation of A . pyogenes alone or A . pyogenes with gram-negative anaerobic bacteria occurred in 91.7% of samples during the postchallenge period. Regardless of bacterial treatment, gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were frequently isolated with A . pyogenes during this period.
TI  - Bacteroides gingivalis vesicles bind to and aggregate Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Isolated Bacteroides gingivalis 2561 vesicles aggregated suspensions of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii of all taxonomy clusters. Vesicles bound near A. viscosus cell walls and among its surface fibrils. Tritiated vesicles bound slightly better to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) than to SHA coated with A. viscosus; saturation was approached at the concentrations that were tested. Pretreatment of A. viscosus-coated SHA with vesicles impaired the subsequent adherence of B. gingivalis whole cells.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to oral tissues: a model for infectious diseases.
AB  - The majority of bacteria which colonize humans display sharp host and tissue tropisms; consequently, relatively little is known about how they initiate colonization on mucosal surfaces. The mouth has a variety of features which have enabled it to serve as a useful model for the discovery of basic principles of host-parasite interactions occurring in mucosal environments. Early studies demonstrated that indigenous bacteria attach to surfaces of the mouth in a highly selective manner; attachment was often observed to correlate with colonization. These studies led to the recognition that bacterial attachment is an essential step for colonization in environments which contain surfaces exposed to a fluid flow. Bacterial adhesion has subsequently grown into a major area of infectious disease research. Many bacteria have been found to possess proteinaceous components, called "adhesins", on their surfaces which bind in a stereochemically specific manner to complementary molecules, or "receptors", on the tissue surface. Adhesins are often lectins which bind to saccharide receptors, but some adhesins are thought to bind to proteinaceous receptors. Studies of components of human saliva, which adsorb to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces similar to those of teeth, and promote the attachment of prominent plaque bacteria, have revealed that the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) promote the attachment of several important bacteria. These include strains of Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, some strains of Streptococcus mutans, and others. The salivary PRP's are a unique family of molecules. However, segments of PRPs are structurally related to collagen. This may be significant, since B. gingivalis and certain cariogenic streptococci bind to collagenous substrata, and such interactions may facilitate their invasion into gingival tissues, or into dentin or cementum, respectively. Another unexpected observation was that although A. viscosus and other bacteria bind avidly to PRPs adsorbed onto apatitic surfaces, they do not interact with PRPs in solution. PRP molecules evidently undergo a conformational change when they adsorb to HA, and adhesins of A. viscosus recognize cryptic segments which are only exposed in adsorbed molecules. This provides the bacteria with a mechanism for efficiently attaching to teeth while suspended in saliva. It also offers a molecular explanation for their sharp tropisms for human teeth. It has proven convenient to refer to such hidden receptors for bacterial adhesins as "cryptitopes" (from cryptic, meaning hidden, and topo, meaning place).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Root canal microflora: qualitative changes after endodontic instrumentation.
AB  - The changes in the pattern of bacteria in root canal after repeated washing with  NaOCl and endodontic instrumentation were evaluated. Samples were obtained from the root canals of patients before and after endodontic instrumentation, and analyzed according to the usual microbiological techniques. Washing with NaOCl and endodontic instrumentation act against bacteria such as Peptostreptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides, whereas Streptococcus lactis and Aerococcus were present before and after endodontic instrumentation. Environmental conditions such as low pH could be responsible for the persistence of gram-positive bacteria. The use of topical treatment and the associated endodontic instrumentation seem useful in the eradication of some bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Humoral immune response to selected subgingival plaque microorganisms in insulin-dependent diabetic children.
AB  - Juvenile diabetics have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontitis following puberty. However, little data are available on changes in the microbial flora that occur at the onset of puberty. This study was performed to determine if antibacterial antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms might be helpful in revealing changes in plaque flora at the onset and conclusion of puberty. Sera was obtained from 35 subjects (ages 7 to 18 years) selected from a population of insulin-dependent diabetics. The subjects were given a thorough medical examination which included an assessment of sexual maturation and a dental examination which included the recording of onset and magnitude of bleeding according to the papillary bleeding score. Antibody titers to A. naeslundii (AN), B. intermedius (BI), B. gingivalis (BG), F. nucleatum (FN), A. actinomycetemcomitans (AA), C. ochracea (CO) and T. denticola (TD) were determined using the microELISA. Stratification of antibody titers by age groups (less than or equal to 12 years, 12 to 15 years, greater than 15 years) revealed that titers to AN increased significantly (P less than 0.025, ANOVA) and progressively (P less than 0.05, regression analysis) with increasing age. In contrast, the titers to FN were maximal in the under 12 year group and decreased with age (ANOVA, P less than 0.05; regression analysis, P less than 0.05). There were no significant variations in titers observed for the other microorganisms. Stratification by sexual maturity revealed a similar progressive decrease of the titer to FN (ANOVA, P less than 0.05; regression analysis, P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Subgingival microflora, dental and periodontal conditions in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.
AB  - Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a rare autosomally recessive disease which leads to severe hypoglycemia. The fructose-free diet of these patients apparently influences dental health. Half of the patients are free of caries, but there are no reports on their periodontal condition nor on the composition of their subgingival microflora. Therefore 18 patient with HFI were examined for the following parameters: radiographic bone loss, caries rate, gingival bleeding, occurrence of calculus, pocket depths, salivary flow rate, buffer capacity and pH from paraffin wax-stimulated saliva. Salivary S. mutans and lactobacilli were also enumerated. Specific antibody titers from whole saliva and serum to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans gamma 4, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were determined with ELISA. Finally the subgingival plaque was analyzed by culture. Altogether 196 anaerobic or microaerophilic isolates representing 29 different species were obtained from the HFI patients and 164 isolates of 26 species from the controls. The frequency of Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, and Wolinella recta in the HFI patients was significantly high The DMF-induces were lower in the study group than in the controls and so was the occurrence of S. mutans and lactobacilli in the saliva. Of the periodontal parameters examined, the only difference found was an increased incidence of gingival bleeding and calculus formation in the HFI patients. The results suggest that in the HFI patients the common gingival bleeding is associated with the more frequent occurrence of Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, and Wolinella recta.
TI  - Aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. Influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  - Twenty-seven oral strains of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as the effect of culture medium, Ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. Of the media tested, GF-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than BHI and TSB, and was used throughout this study. In most cases, Ca-ions (1 mM) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. The final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of S. rattus HG 59 and S. mutans HG 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by Ca-ions. Saliva-induced aggregation was observed for 21 strains of A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, S. cricetus, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. sanguis, and S. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. Seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. Any potential induced aggregation of B. gingivalis HG 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the S. mutans strains under a particular set of conditions. The aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. These microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. In conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental conditions and interference from autoaggregation.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel and  stannous fluoride gel for subgingival bacteria tested in serum at short contact times.
AB  - In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in serum of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel, stannous fluoride gel, stannous fluoride, metronidazole and amoxicillin were determined against Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The minimal inhibitory concentration was assessed by the agar dilution technique. The killing curves and minimal bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial agents in inactivated bovine serum were determined after 5, 10, 20 and 60 minutes contact time. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongst the tested bacteria. A concentration of 128 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine digluconate, 20 mg/ml amine fluoride gel, 1 mg/ml stannous fluoride, 128 micrograms/ml metronidazole and 4 micrograms/ml amoxicillin inhibited the growth of the tested species. The minimal bactericidal concentration in serum for B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena after 10 min contact time was 5 mg/ml for chlorhexidine digluconate and 100 mg/ml for amine fluoride gel. A concentration of 200 mg/ml stannous fluoride gel in serum was bactericidal for the tested species after 10 min contact time, with exception of F. nucleatum.
TI  - Limit dilution analysis of peripheral blood T lymphocytes specific to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Limit dilution analysis (LDA) was used to determine the presence and frequency of periodontopathic-bacteria-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. Twelve adult periodontitis (AP), 13 marginal gingivitis (MG) and 12 healthy control subjects took part in the study. Bacteroides gingivalis and Actinomyces viscosus were used as test organisms, while tetanus toxoid was used as the control antigen. The median PTL-p frequencies to B. gingivalis were 46.33 x 10(-6), 45.33 x 10(-6) and 58.83 x 10(-6) in the control, gingivitis and AP groups respectively, while the median PTL-p frequencies to A. viscosus were 13.8 x 10(-6), 17.33 x 10(-6) and 11.5 x 10(-6), again in the control, gingivitis and AP groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups. All subjects displayed 'single-hit' kinetics with the control tetanus toxoid antigen and, with three exceptions, 'single-hit' kinetics was also found with the two test organisms. One control subject displayed a 'saw-tooth' curve with A. viscosus and a 'suppressor' curve with B. gingivalis, while two MG subjects had a 'saw-tooth' curve with B. gingivalis. These complex curves suggest that, in some subjects, more than one limiting cell type may exist in the cultures. Nevertheless, the results of the present study illustrate that lymphocytes specific to periodontopathic bacteria exist in the peripheral blood of both diseased and non-diseased subjects.
TI  - Ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  - A mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. The swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of Bifidobacterium infantis. Actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. Mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in Acidaminococcus fermentans. High (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also encountered in case of Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides corrodens, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium plauti, Peptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus intermedius, Eubacterium lentum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
TI  - Coaggregation of black-pigmented Bacteroides species with other oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation of Bacteroides gingivalis and other black-pigmented bacteroides with several oral bacteria was studied with "reagent" strains specially prepared by methods that have been described previously. B. gingivalis coaggregated with Veillonella, Capnocytophaga and Actinomyces spp., but not with any Streptococcus spp. Coaggregation of B. gingivalis with other bacteria was inhibited and reversed by lactose. Of the asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteroides, only B. gingivalis demonstrated any coaggregation with other bacteria, whereas within the saccharolytic species, B. loescheii showed a marked ability to coaggregate with several species of oral bacteria. This property of coaggregation by B. gingivalis may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections.
TI  - [Bacterial invasion in periodontitis, is it important in periodontal treatment?].
AB  - During the progression of periodontal disease bacteria invade the epithelial lining of the gingival pocket and the underlying connective tissue. This invasion was demonstrated in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), rapidly progressive periodontitis in adults (RPP) and in children with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome associated periodontitis. Using morphologic criteria or fluorescent antibody staining techniques spirochetes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius, Actinomyces species, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Mycoplasma have been identified in these tissue compartments. Recent light microscopic, electron microscopic and bacteriological studies demonstrated the presence of invading bacteria in the cementum and in the radicular dentin of teeth with periodontal disease. In 83% of 69 carries free periodontally diseased teeth bacteria were present in one of the dentin layer from the root. In 59% of these teeth the dental pulps contained bacteria. The composition of the flora resembled that of the subgingival flora. The use of chlorhexidine, fluoride, tetracyclines or metronidazole in the elimination of invading bacteria following mechanical periodontal therapy is discussed.
TI  - Comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  - For comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for Actinomyces viscosus HG 85 (T14-V) and HG 380 (T14-AV), Bacteroides gingivalis HG 66 (W 83), Streptococcus rattus HG 59 (BHT), and Streptococcus sanguis I HG 169. The entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these assays. The very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. Within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the A. viscosus, S. rattus, and S. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as T50. In microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as TA. For interpretation of the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. The small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the massive sedimentation of aggregates. The moment of inflexion between both phases, TI, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with TA, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. In conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. From 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of oral bacteria to HeLa cells.
AB  - Exfoliated buccal epithelial cells have been widely used in microbial adherence studies, but present a number of problems due to their variable nature and to contamination with indigenous bacteria. An adherence assay was developed using HeLa cell monolayers which were washed with buffer, or treated with saliva or serum to mimic buccal or crevicular epithelial cells, respectively. A total of eighteen strains of oral bacteria tested showed a low affinity for untreated HeLa cells, but most strains adhered in high numbers to saliva treated HeLa cells. A few strains, usually present in the gingival crevice, demonstrated a high affinity for serum treated HeLa cells. Thus, salivary and crevicular fluid components appear to be specifically implicated in the selective adherence and colonization of bacteria on oral surfaces.
TI  - Prevalence of black-pigmented bacteroides species in root canal infections.
AB  - The prevalence of black-pigmented Bacteroides species in the root canals of 72 teeth with apical periodontitis was evaluated. Twenty-two of the canals contained one or more species of black-pigmented Bacteroides. Bacteroides intermedius (14 strains) and Bacteroides endodontalis (5 strains) were most common. Of the species Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides loeschei, and Bacteroides denticola, 2, 3, and 1 strains, respectively, were isolated. The median number of bacterial cells recovered from the root canals containing black-pigmented Bacteroides was 2.8 x 10(5) and from the other canals 3.0 x 10(3). The mean number of strains was 7.9 and 3.3, respectively. Sixteen of the 22 root canals containing black-pigmented Bacteroides species were associated with acute apical abscesses and purulent drainage through the root canal. The other six teeth with black-pigmented Bacteroides were asymptomatic. One additional abscess was present among the 72 cases.

TI  - [Inducing effect of periodontopathic bacteria on activation of macrophage functions and production of interleukin-1 by mouse peritoneal macrophages].
AB  - Periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by a bacterial infection and subsequently developed by immunopathological mechanisms thorough host-parasite interactions. The macrophage and lymphocyte are the major functional cell types in the lesion of the disease and participate in tissue destruction and alteration of the periodontal connective tissue as well as in host defense mechanisms. However, the detailed implications of macrophages in development of the disease is still unclear. The aim of this study was to gain more understanding of the functional role of macrophages in periodontal disease. In this study, we examined the inducing effects of sonicated extracts from some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and Actinomyces viscosus, on activation of macrophage functions and IL-1 production by the macrophages from the mouse peritoneum. At a dose as low as 1 microgram/ml (dry weight) sonicated extracts from B. gingivalis induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. A significant increase in the acid phosphatase and in glucose consumption was observed in the cultures at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the addition of the sonicate. Sonicated extracts from A. viscosus, a gram-positive bacterium, as well as B. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and H. actinomycetemcomitans, gram-negative ones, were able to induce the increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of the macrophages. These periodontopathic bacteria were found to strongly induce IL-1 production by the macrophages as early as 24 h after addition of the sonicates. A significant increase in the IL-1 production was observed at a dose of 1 microgram/ml of the sonicates. The inducing ability was equivalent to 1 microgram/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The highest production of IL-1 was observed in the macrophages treated with H. actinomycetemcomitans among these sonicates. Sonicated extracts from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were able to induce the IL-1 production by macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice, which are LPS low-responders. These results suggest that periodontopathic bacteria have potent ability to induce macrophage activation and IL-1 production and that the activated macrophages may play an important role in development of periodontal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - DNA probe detection of key periodontal pathogens in juveniles.
AB  - Recognition of juvenile forms of periodontitis have been shown to be directly linked with specific Gram-negative rods, primarily Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius. However, clinical application of these laboratory findings have generally been restricted to the research environment. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of these three pathogenic species in children using the reliable and accurate new technology of DNA probes. Results indicated that the pathogenic oral flora did not differ significantly between subjects with and without gingival inflammation. Therefore, tracking of pathogens using clinical parameters of inflammation are unreliable and accurate monitoring requires microbiological testing in order to properly identify the presence or absence of pathogens.

TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  - Bacterial involvement in denture-induced stomatitis.
AB  - Denture and mucosal plaque samples were collected from eight full-denture wearers of whom four suffered from denture-induced stomatitis (DIS). Cultures were made, and a proportional identification to species level was carried out of bacteria and yeasts. An inventory was made of the predominant flora. Results showed that the predominant microflora of both groups, both on dentures and the denture-bearing mucosa, consisted mainly of Gram-positive bacteria. Differences in the proportions of cocci were found between the predominant bacterial flora on the dentures. In the control group, 69% of the denture flora consisted of cocci, while on the dentures of the DIS group a mean of 33% cocci was found. Neither group of palates revealed any differences in the proportions of cocci. On these locations a mean of 69% was found. The plaque of dentures and the palates of the healthy group showed means of 35% and 31%, respectively, of obligate anaerobic bacteria, while in the DIS group these percentages were 56% and 43%, respectively. No obligately aerobic bacteria were found. Candida species was detected in both groups, both on dentures and palates in very low numbers (DIS group, median palates 0.02%, median dentures 0.25%). The predominant organisms were Streptococcus species, of which S. salivarius was mostly present on the palates of both groups. Other species which were regularly found at different locations were Veillonella parvula and species of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Actinomyces.

TI  - Relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. The sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. All clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. Certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. The combination of F. nucleatum, B. forsyth and W. recta (cluster VII) or B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and S. intermedius (cluster VIII) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. These clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. Clusters dominated by V. parvula (cluster III), the Actinomyces sp. (cluster X) or the combination of S. sanguis II, S. mitis, V. parvula and S. intermedius (cluster II) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more favorably to therapy. Sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. Active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". The predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Among the 33 subjects, W. recta, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, B. gingivalis and B. forsythus were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, S. mitis, C. ochracea, S. sanguis II, V. parvula and an unnamed Actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. The likelihood of a site being active was increased if B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, P. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, W. recta, or B. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if S. sanguis II, the Actinomyces sp., or C. ochracea were detected.
TI  - Use of Percoll density gradients for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral  epithelial cells.
AB  - An assay for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral epithelial cells has been developed which utilizes Percoll density gradient centrifugation to separate bacteria and epithelial cells. 3H-thymidine-labeled bacteria were incubated with suspensions of buccal epithelial cells in microtitration plates for 2.5 hr at 35 degrees C. The mixtures were then subjected to density gradient centrifugation in 50% Percoll. Epithelial cells with attached bacteria formed a band near the top of the tube, while unattached bacteria formed a band near the bottom. The epithelial cells were collected on membrane filters, and the number of attached bacteria was determined by scintillation counting. Binding of S. mitis C5 was found to increase with time, and equilibrium was attained within two hr. Saturation of available binding sites occurred when 10(7) S. mitis cells were incubated with 1.5 x 10(4) buccal epithelial cells. The numbers of streptococci which attached as determined with this assay were in good agreement with values obtained by direct microscopic counts. Adsorption of S. mitis C5 cells was adequately described by a Langmuir isotherm (correlation coefficient 0.998). This permitted calculation of estimates of the number of binding sites and the affinity of the organism. The assay proved reliable even when as few as 1000 epithelial cells were used. Treating the epithelial cells with neuraminidase or trypsin significantly decreased the number of S. mitis C5 cells which attached. In contrast, binding of A. naeslundii 12104 to neuraminidase-treated cells was increased, and attachment of B. gingivalis 381 was also enhanced, especially to epithelial cells which had been treated with trypsin.
TI  - Intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The human oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. As the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. Rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as Actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. The ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of human periodontal disease.
TI  - The effect of a copper intra-uterine contraceptive device on the microbial ecology of the female genital tract.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from 108 intra-uterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) removed from patients with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), haemorrhage, pregnancy and from asymptomatic women, and from the genital tracts of 66 healthy controls not wearing an IUCD, were studied. No significant differences were found in the types of micro-organisms or isolation rates from IUCDs removed from women in the various clinical groups. The isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria from IUCDs removed from asymptomatic wearers was significantly lower than that from controls, with the exception of the isolation rate of actinomyces which was significantly higher in IUCD wearers and A. israelii was recovered only from IUCDs. The isolation rates of the different bacterial species varied with the duration of the device in utero. The presence of a copper IUCD altered the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. The insertion of such a device and the ecological changes that follow play a crucial role in the development of PID.
TI  - Coaggregation among periodontal pathogens, emphasizing Bacteroides gingivalis--Actinomyces viscosus cohesion on a saliva-coated mineral surface.
AB  - Teeth offer nonshedding surfaces on which a wide range of bacterial species accumulate as thick, cohesive plaques. Intergeneric coaggregation mediated by specific recognition between surface "cohesins" is thought to contribute to both the cohesiveness of plaque and the sequence in which bacteria colonize the tooth surface. There is some evidence that Gram-positive species, like the efficient tooth colonizer Actinomyces viscosus, enhance subsequent tooth colonization by the more virulent periodontal pathogen Bacteroides gingivalis. To study their mechanism of cohesion, we have developed an in vitro assay that measures the sequential binding of tritium-labeled B. gingivalis to A. viscosus adsorbed to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads, mimicking teeth (actinobeads). The assay yields equilibrium and kinetics data amenable to statistical analysis. The presence of A. viscosus significantly increased the number of B. gingivalis cells bound. Inhibition studies were conducted to test the sensitivity of binding to heat; to various saccharides and sugar amines; to proteolytic treatment of Bacteroides; and to incorporation of various chaotropic agents, increased KCl, and saliva in the suspension buffer. Heating the Bacteroides cells but not the actinobeads diminished Bacteroides adherence. Proteolysis and various saccharides had little, if any, effect. Among chaotropic agents, NaSCN and LiCl reduced numbers of cells bound by 40%, but tetramethylurea had no effect. Increasing the ionic concentration of KCl reduced binding by 50 to 60%. Diluted saliva showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of B. gingivalis adherence to actinobeads. To begin examining B. gingivalis surface molecules significant to these reactions, lipopolysaccharide was extracted by the phenol-water method and analyzed by biochemical assays and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Localization and enumeration of fimbria-associated adhesins of Bacteroides loescheii.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies that specifically inhibit coaggregation between Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 and its two gram-positive partners Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israelii PK14 were used to enumerate and localize two distinct types of fimbria-associated adhesins on the surface of B. loescheii. Binding studies with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies indicated that a maximum (Bmax calculated from Scatchard plots) of approximately 400 adhesin molecules specific for S. sanguis and 310 adhesin molecules specific for A. israelii reside on the surface of the cell. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the adhesins were not an integral part of the fimbrial subunit; rather, they were usually found on the distal portion of the structures arranged in a random fashion.
TI  - The synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. Both Eubacterium lentum and Streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. The susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/L; only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime against members of the genus Bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/L. The MIC50 of cefotaxime to Bacteroides fragilis and B. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/L, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/L, respectively, when 4 mg/L desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. Full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the Bacteroides species tested. While cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus Bacteroides, the MIC of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. Metronidazole was the most active agent; only Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant. Clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the Bacteroides fragilis group. At a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of Fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. The highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the B. fragilis group. Within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. We conclude that metronidazole has the most predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  - Characterization of monoclonal antibodies to fimbria-associated adhesins of Bacteroides loescheii PK1295.
AB  - Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 fimbriae, which mediate the lactose-sensitive coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34 and the lactose-insensitive coaggregation with Actinomyces israelii PK14, were injected into mice to raise adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Supernatants of hybridomas were screened for the capacity to inhibit coaggregation and agglutinate intact bacteria. Of the 10 MAbs that were isolated, 4 were specific and potent inhibitors of the coaggregation between B. loescheii and S. sanguis and two other MAbs specifically inhibited the B. loescheii-A. israelii interaction. None of the six MAbs which inhibited adherence were capable of agglutinating whole cells of B. loescheii, whereas the four remaining MAbs agglutinated whole cells but had no effect on coaggregation. Fab fragments of two MAbs, one that inhibited the coaggregation with S. sanguis and another that inhibited the interaction with A. israelii, also were shown to inhibit the respective coaggregation interactions, suggesting that each of the immunoglobulins recognized its adhesin molecule at or near the active sites. By immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation, the S. sanguis adhesin-specific MAbs reacted with a 75-kilodalton polypeptide present in fimbria-enriched preparations, whereas the A. israelii adhesin-specific MAbs recognized a 45-kilodalton polypeptide in the same preparations. By screening hybridoma supernatants directly for their capacity to block coaggregation, we isolated MAbs which were used to establish that the B. loescheii-S. sanguis and the B. loescheii-A. israelii interactions were mediated by different adhesins.
TI  - Early microbial colonization of permucosal implants in edentulous patients.
AB  - In edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. Samples were taken from mucosa and dentures before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. In total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. The samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. The supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by Gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by Haemophilus spp. and Veillonella parvula. A group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Leptotrichia buccalis. Black-pigmented Bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. Spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. It is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. The presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.
TI  - Attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular constituents of this matrix. Radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from PF HR-9 cells. Bacteroides gingivalis 33277, Fusobacterium nucleatum FN-2, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans GA3(A) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of A. actinomycetemcomitans GA3(NA) and SUNY AB67 (range, 20 to 25%). The attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). Competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of B. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. Similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of B. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. The adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. Strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated matrix proteins. The results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as B. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. On the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. The results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.
TI  - Bacteroides gingivalis-Actinomyces viscosus cohesive interactions as measured by  a quantitative binding assay.
AB  - There is limited evidence, mostly indirect, to suggest that the adherence of Bacteroides gingivalis to teeth may be enhanced by the presence of gram-positive dental plaque bacteria like Actinomyces viscosus. The purpose of this study was to carry out direct quantitative assessments of the cohesion of B gingivalis and A. viscosus by using an in vitro assay modeled on the natural sequence in which these two species colonize the teeth. The assay allowed comparisons to be made of the adherence of 3H-labeled B. gingivalis 2561 and 381 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (S-HA) and A. viscosus WVU627- or T14V-coated S-HA (actinobeads) in equilibrium and kinetics binding studies. A series of preliminary binding studies with 3H-labeled A. viscosus and parallel studies by scanning electron microscopy with unlabeled A. viscosus were conducted to establish a protocol by which actinobeads suitable for subsequent Bacteroides adherence experiments could be prepared. By scanning electron microscopy, the actinobeads had only small gaps of exposed S-HA between essentially irreversibly bound A. viscosus cells. Furthermore, B. gingivalis cells appeared to bind preferentially to the Actinomyces cells instead of the exposed S-HA. B. gingivalis binding to both S-HA and actinobeads was saturable with at least 2 X 10(9) to 3 X 10(9) cells per ml, and equilibrium with saturating concentrations was reached within 10 to 20 min. B. gingivalis always bound in greater numbers to the actinobeads than to S-HA. These findings provide direct measurements supporting the concept that cohesion with dental plaque bacteria like A. viscosus may foster the establishment of B. gingivalis on teeth by enhancing its adherence.

TI  - Fimbria-associated proteins of Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
AB  - Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israelii PK14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. Whereas coaggregation with S. sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with A. israelii PK14. Coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of B. loescheii PK1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. Selection for spontaneously occurring Cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. Type I lost the ability to coaggregate with S. sanguis 34, whereas type II failed to coaggregate with either S. sanguis 34 or A. israelii PK14. Purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and agglutination with S. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kDa) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kDa protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type I mutant. Neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type II mutants. Our data suggest that coaggregation of B. loescheii PK1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kDa polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of S. sanguis 34 and A. israelii PK14 cells, respectively.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  - We assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive oral bacteria. Changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. Chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative as well as the Gram-positive oral bacteria. The alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented Gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. Alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. Hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane) and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against Fusobacterium nucleatum, also associated with periodontal disease. Seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against Actinomyces species. All test agents were active against Streptococcus mutans, a Gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. Hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. Analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Certain bacterial species and morphotypes in localized juvenile periodontitis and in matched controls.
AB  - Subgingival microflora in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) was examined by  culture of certain bacterial species and by direct dark-field microscopy in affected and unaffected periodontal pockets of 11 patients and in their age- and sex-matched controls. Only Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) correlated to periodontal destruction and occurred most frequently at the affected LJP sites. A.a., Bacteroides intermedius and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated in proportions greater than 5% of the flora at the affected LJP sites, but various Actinomyces spp. at the unaffected and control sites. The proportions of straight rods, fusiforms and small spirochetes correlated to gingival bleeding tendency and were higher at the affected LJP sites than at the control sites. Certain nonpigmented Bacteroides spp. and Eikenella corrodens were never isolated when only cocci were seen at dark-field microscopy. The more complex the flora, the more frequently B. intermedius occurred. The results support a significant role for A.a. in LJP and indicate that certain bacterial species appear to prefer occurring in the complex composition of subgingival microflora.
TI  - Production of monoclonal antibodies that recognize specific and cross-reactive antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the cell surface antigens of Fusobacterium nucleatum 263 were obtained by fusion of murine myeloma cells (P3-NSI/1-Ag4-1) with the splenocytes of BALB/c mice immunized with whole cells of F. nucleatum 263. Screening was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the immunizing strain, F. nucleatum 263. Further selection was done using a bacterial panel consisting of Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Escherichia species. Twelve MAbs were selected on the basis of this screening procedure, seven of which reacted specifically with F. nucleatum 263. Two reacted with F. nucleatum 263 and ATCC 25586, and three reacted with F. nucleatum 263, ATCC 25586, and UQD-003 (a clinical isolate) and also cross-reacted with Fusobacterium russii ATCC 25533. The selected MAbs were then further characterized by absorption experiments with suspensions of intact whole bacterial cells, and the residual binding activity of the supernatants was determined in an ELISA. To determine whether the MAbs reacted with the same or different epitopes, pairs of MAbs were reacted together and independently in a checkerboard manner in an ELISA. The additive or nonadditive nature of the reactivity was determined. A competitive inhibition assay was performed using one labeled and selected unlabeled MAbs. The results of these experiments suggested some epitope sharing among the selected MAbs that reacted with a specific antigen on F. nucleatum and also shared cross-reactive antigens with the three strains of F. nucleatum and F. russii.

AB  - 359 patients underwent laparoscopy to verify the diagnosis of salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was found in 187 (52%) cases. Laparoscopy revealed normal conditions in 136 (37%) cases. Other diseases were diagnosed in 36 (10%) cases. Bacteriological cultures from the fimbrial lumen were positive in 24% of the PID cases. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) was detected in 12%, Bacteroides species (BS) in 5%, Actinomyces israelii (AI) in 3%, Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) in 2%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in 1%, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) in 1%. Cervical cultures were positive for NG and/or CT in 71% of the PID cases but only in 19% of the non-PID cases. From these no positive intra-abdominal cultures were detected. Serological tests for CT were carried out. A positive acute titre of greater than or equal to 1/64 was noted in 37%, a seroconversion (X4) 2-3 weeks later was found in 14%. Positive serology despite a negative culture was registered in 19%.
TI  - Keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  - A test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. Keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 1 mM dithiothreitol. The degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. Several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Treponema denticola, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Brevibacterium epidermidis, Brevibacterium lines, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Corynebacterium ovis, and Rhodococcus equi. The dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. The test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in Trichophyton rubrum, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, B. linens, B. epidermidis, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Treponema denticola. The keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
TI  - Direct modulation of human neutrophil adherence by coaggregating periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Direct interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum and PMNs produced consistent enhancement of PMN adherence. In contrast, consistent suppression of PMN adherence was observed after direct interactions between PMNs and Bacteroides gingivalis or Actinomyces viscosus. The modulatory effects of these periodontopathic bacteria on PMN function could be seen as early as 2 min after interaction. The effects were abrogated by alterations of bacterial structural integrity with heat, formalin or ultrasonic disruption. Carbohydrate or glycoprotein receptors on PMNs may be involved because the effects were blocked by monosaccharides in the medium. Coaggregation experiments showed that permutations involving F. nucleatum always resulted in enhancement of PMN adherence, and that this can be blocked by D-galactose. These findings may have implications in the initiation and sustenance of chronic inflammatory tissue damage in periodontitis.
TI  - A bacteriological study of rampant caries in children.
AB  - We undertook a microbiological study, in children, of dental plaque from sound surfaces or associated with rampant caries, both black-colored and unstained. Improved selective media allowed for the enumeration of bacteria belonging to specific genera or species present in plaque samples. A nearly similar bacterial distribution was found in both types of rampant caries. Aciduric flora, Streptococcus mutans, Veillonella, and Lactobacillus predominated in plaque over the lesions, whereas extracellular polysaccharide-producing streptococci other than S. mutans, as well as Actinomyces, were more abundant in plaque from sound surfaces. However, more lactobacilli and Actinomyces were recovered from pigmented lesions than from the unstained ones. These findings suggest that the microbial flora associated with black-pigmented lesions did not strongly differ from that observed over unstained caries lesions.

TI  - Multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  - A radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. The cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. The coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. Competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. Attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. However, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. This not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. Thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. While the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.
TI  - Arylaminopeptidase activities of oral bacteria.
AB  - Protease and peptidase enzymes are thought to play a role in the virulence of many oral organisms, especially those associated with periodontal diseases. In order to evaluate the peptidases of periodontopathogens, we compared the arylaminopeptidase activities of Bacteroides gingivalis with those of other oral and non-oral bacteria. Sixty-three bacterial strains representing the prominent cultivable organisms in human periodontal pockets were tested, including representatives of the black-pigmented Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Each micro-organism was examined for its ability to hydrolyze 18 synthetic substrates of beta-naphthylamide derivatives of amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides. Quantitation of the enzyme activity was accomplished by colorimetric measurement of the amounts of released beta-naphthylamines. N-CBz-glycyl-glycyl-L-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was readily cleaved by B. gingivalis, but slightly or not at all by the other oral strains tested. L-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was cleaved by B. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga species, and Streptococcus species, but not readily by the other Bacteroides strains. Some dipeptide substrates tested, such as glycyl-L-arginine- and glycyl-L-proline-beta-naphthylamide, were strongly cleaved by B. gingivalis and weakly cleaved by other Bacteroides strains. Since high levels of N-CBz-glycyl-glycyl-L-arginyl-aminopeptidase activity are characteristic of B. gingivalis, its measurement may be valuable in the identification of this organism in clinical samples as an aid in diagnosis and monitoring of periodontal infections. Furthermore, this and other aminopeptidases produced by B. gingivalis and other oral organisms may play a role in the tissue destruction seen in periodontal disease.

TI  - Short-term failure of IUD removal to alter bacterial flora in a patient with chronic anaerobic endometritis.
AB  - A patient with cytological and clinical evidence of IUD-associated anaerobic endometritis was studied with quantitative and qualitative bacteriological techniques. With the exception of elimination of Actinomyces israelii from the deep endocervical/endometrial culture, IUD removal induced minimal qualitative changes in the bacterial flora of the endocervical/endometrial sample during the 35 days the patient was monitored. The interposition of menstruation did not significantly alter either the quantitative or qualitative interrelationship of the bacteria present.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Fluorescent antibody and flagella stains for rapid detection of bacteria at periodontally healthy and diseased sites.
AB  - Two rapid methods of identifying bacteria associated with periodontal disease were investigated to determine their diagnostic usefulness in longitudinal or epidemiologic studies. Three nonmotile organisms were identified by fluorescent antibody stains (FA) while percentages of motile bacteria were assessed by counting all spirochetes, flagellated and nonflagellated organisms stained with a simplified silver-plating stain for flagella. Relationships between disease activity and these bacteria from subgingival plaque samples taken at 18 individual sites (12 diseased, 6 healthy) were determined by correlating the quantity of detectable bacteria with the Gingival Index (GI), Plaque Index (PLI) and probing depth (PD). The highest correlations found with the FA stains were between Bacteroides gingivalis and probing depth (rs = 0.85), GI (rs = 0.80) and PLI (rs = 0.80). Bacteroides melaninogenicus and/or Bacteroides intermedius also correlated well with the GI (rs = 0.66), PLI (rs = 0.64), and PD (rs = 0.59), but to a lesser degree than B. gingivalis. Flagella stains showed that spirochetes correlated highly with PD (rs = 0.82), as did the total motile group with PLI (rs = 0.82). Motile bacteria alone were only moderately associated with the clinical parameters measured. The results of this investigation suggest that FA- and flagella-staining methods can be valuable screening tools for the detection of bacterial species and motile organisms in longitudinal or epidemiologic studies.

TI  - Effects of ammonia and volatile fatty acids produced by oral bacteria on tissue culture cells.
AB  - Culture filtrates of several bacterial species isolated from the oral cavity were tested for their effects on two types of tissue culture cells: Vero cells, the continuous cell line of African green monkey kidney cells; and chondrocytes, isolated from 15-day-old chick embryo tibiae. Only a limited number of bacterial species--i.e., the asaccharolytic black-pigmented Bacteroides species and Fusobacterium species--affected the two cell types. The effect on Vero cells, detected by the rounding of the cells, correlated with the butyric acid concentration in the bacterial supernatant, which confirms previous findings. A small enhancement of this effect was found with propionic acid and ammonium ions. The same strains which affected Vero cells also affected chondrocytes, detected by a vacuolization of the cells. However, volatile fatty acids on their own had no visible effect on these cells. Instead, ammonium ion in the culture filtrate, when present in concentrations of 20 to 60 mmol/L, proved to be responsible for vacuolization of the chondrocytes. The volatile fatty acids (butyric and propionic) had a limited additive effect. No effects were visible with cell extracts of the bacteria.
TI  - Gingivitis.
AB  - Gingivitis is caused by substances derived from microbial plaque accumulating at  or near the gingival sulcus; all other suspected local and systemic etiologic factors either enhance plaque accumulation or retention, or enhance the susceptibility of the gingival tissue to microbial attack. Microbial species specifically associated with gingival health include Streptococcus sanguis 1, S. D-7, and Fusobacterium naviforme. Bacteria involved in the etiology of gingivitis include specific species of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Treponema and possibly Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, and Eikenella. Microbial colonization and participation is sequential, with the complexity of the associated flora increasing with time. The pathogenesis has been separated into the initial, early, and established stages, each with characteristic features. The initial lesion is an acute inflammation which can be induced experimentally by application of extracts of plaque bacteria to normal gingiva. The early lesion is characterized by a lymphoid cell infiltrate predominated by T lymphocytes, characteristic of lesions seen at sites of cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. The early lesion can be induced by application of purified contact antigens to the gingival tissues of previously sensitized animals. As the clinical condition worsens, the established lesion appears, predominated by B lymphocytes and plasma cells. Established lesions may remain stable for indefinite periods of time, they may revert, or they may progress. Periodontal destruction does not result from the conversion of a predominantly T cell to a predominantly B cell lesion as has been suggested, but rather from episodes of acute inflammation. Clinical manifestations of gingivitis are episodic phenomena characterized by discontinuous bursts of acute inflammation. Most lesions are transient or persistent but not progressive. Attachment loss may precede alveolar bone loss and may occur without the manifestations of a concurrent or a precursor gingivitis. On the other hand, the evidence indicates that a portion of gingivitis lesions can and does progress to periodontitis. Gingivitis and the periodontal microflora differ in children and adults. Clinical signs of gingivitis either do not appear as plaque accumulates, or they are greatly delayed in children, and the inflammatory infiltrate consists mostly of T lymphocytes. The conversion to a B cell lesion does not appear to occur. The evidence supports the conclusion that gingivitis is a disease, and that control and prevention is a worthwhile goal and a health benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of lowering the pH on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  - Nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at D = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. After an initial period of steady-state growth at pH 7.0, pH control was discontinued. The pH then decreased until it stabilized at pH 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the Eh rose from -165 mV to +160 mV. The lowering in pH resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. At pH 7.0, 'Streptococcus mitior', Veillonella alcalescens and S. sanguis were most numerous while at pH 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for Lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. The proportions of S. mutans within the community also increased while S. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and Bacteroides intermedius was not detected below pH 4.6. The survival at pH 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. Relative to pH 7.0, the community growing at pH 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider pH range but amino acid metabolism decreased. In general, when pH control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for B. intermedius, which was still not detected. The inverse relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans, and the increase in proportions of L. casei and S. mutans during growth in a low pH environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.
TI  - The habitat of periodontopathic micro-organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the significance of oral mucosal surfaces as a habitat of periodontopathic micro-organisms. For this investigation, 7 young adults were selected for an experimental gingivitis study. At the start of the experiment, bacterial samples were taken by means of a sterile swab from 4 oral mucosal surfaces: the buccal mucosa, the vestibular fold, the dorsum of the tongue and a tonsil. All individuals were asked to abstain from oral hygiene procedures in 1 quadrant of the mouth for a period of 23 days. At the end of this period, plaque samples were taken from 4 tooth surfaces by means of a sterile periodontal probe just coronal from the gingival margin. The study included evaluation of spirochetes and motile organisms by means of phase-contrast microscopy and of black-pigmented Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga by means of cultural studies. Results showed a relationship between the prevalence of motile organisms and black-pigmented Bacteroides in samples from both the mucosal surfaces and the 23-day-old plaque. In addition, a relationship was found between the presence of motile organisms on the dorsum of the tongue at the start of the experiment and their prevalence in the 23-day-old plaque. It was suggested that the dorsum of the tongue may function as a nidus for periodontopathic micro-organisms.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - A note on ultra-violet red fluorescence of anaerobic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Anaerobes other than the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group isolated from clinical material produce an ultra-violet red fluorescence when grown under certain conditions in vitro. These organisms include other members of the genus Bacteroides as well as strains of some species of Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. The major fluorescent pigment was identified as protoporphyrin IX. Factors necessary for the production of fluorescence are the presence of blood or haem and a fermentable carbohydrate during growth on a solid medium. Fluorescence intensity was related to the concentration of blood and fermentable carbohydrate present but was independent of inoculum size. Certain commercially available blood agar bases designed specifically for the isolation of fastidious anaerobes from clinical material which contain added carbohydrate were shown to induce fluorescence in certain organisms. This may lead to the misidentification of some anaerobes as B. melaninogenicus.
TI  - [Microbial pathogenesis of Whipple's disease].
AB  - In a case of Whipple's disease with electron microscopic demonstration of rod-shaped bacteria we could isolate Propionibacterium acnes (former name: Corynebacterium anaerobium), Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus from duodenal biopsies by the aid of modern anaerobic culture technique. Simultaneously we found a dysbiosis (increase of anaerobic coca and anaerobes) in du odenal juice. After antibiotic treatment Propionibacterium and Lactobacillus disappeared and an other type of dysbiosis (appearance of Bacteroides) was to be seen. In discussion is a change of immunologic state and following disturbed regulation of microbial colonization in the small bowel of patients with Whipple's disease.

TI  - Evaluation of the RapID-ANA system for identification of anaerobic bacteria of veterinary origin.
AB  - This study evaluated the ability of the RapID-ANA system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.) to accurately identify a spectrum of freshly isolated veterinary anaerobes. A total of 183 isolates were tested and included 7 Actinomyces spp., 53 Bacteroides spp., 32 Clostridium spp., 2 Eubacterium spp., 65 Fusobacterium spp., 1 Peptococcus spp., 22 Peptostreptococcus spp., and 1 Propionibacterium spp. All isolates were initially identified by conventional biochemical testing and gas-liquid chromatography of short-chain fatty acid metabolites. Additional tests were performed as required by the RapID-ANA system. Of these isolates, 81.4% were correctly identified to the genus level, including 59.6% to the species level, 14.2% were incorrectly identified at the genus level, and 4.4% were not identified. Initially, 20.2% of the strains were not identified because the microcodes were not in the code book. The majority of the incorrect identifications were caused by the misidentification of Fusobacterium spp. as Bacteroides spp. Errors also occurred when veterinary anaerobes not included in the data base were assigned an identification from the existing data base. The RapID-ANA system appears to be a promising new method for rapid identification of veterinary anaerobes; however, further evaluation with an extended data base is needed before the system can accurately identify all clinically significant anaerobes.

TI  - Predominant obligate anaerobes in human carious dentin.
AB  - With the adoption of an anaerobic glove box system, we isolated and identified the predominant micro-organisms in lesions of carious dentin from four permanent third molars. The overwhelming majority of the micro-organisms isolated from both shallow and deep layers of carious dentin were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that conditions in the dentin were strictly anaerobic. The predominant obligate anaerobes were Gram-positive rods which were identified as members of the following genera: Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, Arachnia, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Actinomyces. Clostridia, Gram-negative rods (Bacteroides and Fusobacterium) and Gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Streptococcus) were also isolated, although they constituted a minor part of the flora.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Cultivable microflora of plaque from full denture bases and adjacent palatal mucosa.
AB  - Anaerobic cultural techniques and rapid biochemical identification tests normally employed for periodontal plaque were utilized for the analysis of plaque samples taken from denture bases and corresponding adjacent mucosa. Results were compared with those or more comprehensive microbiological investigations. Forty four samples were obtained from the denture bases and adjacent palatal mucosa of 12 patients wearing full upper dentures. The specimens were then collected in Reduced Transport Fluid and processed in the anaerobic glove box. Samples were plated on Enriched Trypticase Soy Agar (ETSA) and cultured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In addition plaque samples were plated on Sabouraud medium. Facultative bacteria predominated in both denture and palatal plaques. Significantly greater numbers of cocci were recovered in the samples from palatal mucosa. More rods were found in denture plaque. Anaerobes were present in both instances. Among the anaerobes, saccharolytic Bacteroides were identified with the highest frequency, while Veillonella species were present in the greatest quantity. Recovery of yeasts was similar for both ETSA and Sabouraud media incubated aerobically. As has been found in other microbiological studies Candida albicans represented only a minor part of the total cultivable flora.
TI  - Generalized juvenile periodontitis, defective neutrophil chemotaxis and Bacteroides gingivalis in a 13-year-old female. A case report.
AB  - Host immune responses and the predominant subgingival microflora were evaluated in a 13-year-old female exhibiting a severe form of generalized juvenile periodontitis. The patient's neutrophils were chemotactically depressed but exhibited a normal oxidative capacity. Serum IgG antibody to Bacteroides gingivalis and to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c were elevated. Significantly, B. gingivalis constituted 8 to 16% of the cultivable microflora and 13 to 20% of the total cell count in subgingival plaque samples obtained from five out of five periodontally diseased sites examined. It was not detectable in a healthy site. A. actinomycetemcomitans was recovered in small numbers from all subgingival plaque samples taken. The present study provides additional evidence for an etiologic association between B. gingivalis and generalized juvenile periodontitis.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  - In this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. The patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. The bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. Periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus and S. mutans and significantly lower proportions of B. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. The spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (AP) patients, averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. The bacteriological results could not distinguish between ADA Type III and IV periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any AP patient. The patients designated as early onset periodontitis (EOP) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides gingivalis and/or B. intermedius. Two types of EOP were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. Four localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients were notable in not having detectable A. actinomycetemcomitans. The data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of LJP are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent B. gingivalis and B. intermedius.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - In vitro activity of Sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. Both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. All organisms except a single strain of Fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either Sch 34343 or imipenem. Overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly Lactobacillus species, Clostridium difficile, and Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. Cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. It had excellent and selective activity against B. fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the B. fragilis group. Both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against C. difficile and Lactobacillus spp. Although cefbuperazone was more active against Bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and all Bacteroides spp. other than B. fragilis and B. vulgatus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefbuperazone, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The 90% MIC of cefbuperazone (BMY 25182) was 32 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp., 128 micrograms/ml for Fusobacterium and Clostridium spp., 64 micrograms/ml for Eubacterium and Peptococcus spp., 8 micrograms/ml for Actinomyces spp., and 32 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus spp. The level of activity of cefbuperazone was higher against B. fragilis and lower against anaerobic cocci than those of related cephalosporins, i.e., cefoxitin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and cefmenoxime. However, the activity of cefbuperazone was comparable to that of moxalactam against all groups tested. Size of inoculum and type of media used did not alter the MICs of cefbuperazone for B. fragilis. Cefbuperazone showed synergistic activity when combined with cefoxitin against resistant strains of B. fragilis.
TI  - Effects of peptidoglycans from periodontal pathogens on selected biological activities of CD-1 murine peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Resident CD-1 murine peritoneal macrophages were exposed to various concentrations of purified peptidoglycan isolated from members of the genera Bacteroides, Eikenella, and Actinomyces. Macrophage viability, the release of lysozyme, acid phosphatase, and prostaglandins E1 and E2 were assayed as a function of peptidoglycan concentration and time. Macrophages responded as a function of peptidoglycan concentration with increased release of acid phosphatase and prostaglandins; all cells remained greater than 90% viable during the course of the experiments. However, concentrations of peptidoglycan greater than 50 micrograms/mL were toxic to the macrophages, while the peptidoglycan from B. capillus strain 925.08 and Actinomyces viscosus strain T14AV consumed complement by both the classical and the alternate pathways. Cellular lysozyme activity and phagocytosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were significantly reduced in the presence of peptidoglycan. When viewed by scanning electron microscopy, the activated macrophages were rounded, lacked distinct pseudopod extensions, and possessed an increased number of microvilli and plasma membrane associated vesicles. These morphological alterations occurred as early as 3 h. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the purified peptidoglycan to have been taken up into numerous phagosomes; however, even after 24 h incubation, it was only partially degraded.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the peptidoglycans from selected gram-positive  and gram-negative periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The peptidoglycans from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive periodontal pathogens were isolated, purified, and characterized both morphologically and chemically. In addition, the effects of the mureolytic enzymes, lysozyme, M-1 N-acetyl-muramidase, and the AM-3 endopeptidase, on the peptidoglycans were examined. These enzymes were found to be highly effective in the degradation of the purified peptidoglycans; however, a Bacteroides capillus peptidoglycan-protein complex exhibited a greater resistance to these enzymes. Morphologically, the peptidoglycans consisted of large saccular sheets which, when viewed by scanning electron microscopy, contained numerous holes and tears. Chemically, the peptidoglycans consisted of muramic acid, glucosamine, alanine, glutamic acid, and meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP). One Bacteroides species, Bacteroides gingivalis strain W, contained glycine and LL-DAP, suggestive of an indirectly cross-linked A3 gamma peptidoglycan.

TI  - Enhancement of experimental actinomycosis in mice by Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - The infectivity of Actinomyces israelii in a susceptible-weanling-mouse was increased by the presence of Eikenella corrodens in the inoculum. A minimal infecting dose of 1.7 X 10(7) CFU of A. israelii was required to establish chronic lesions after an intraperitoneal injection. When E. corrodens (3.8 X 10(7) CFU) was included in the inoculum, chronic lesions were established with a dose of 8.5 X 10(4) CFU of A. israelii. E. corrodens alone did not produce persistent lesions. Viable E. corrodens could be recovered from chronic mixed actinomycotic lesions in numbers that often equaled or exceeded the populations of A. israelii in the lesions. The duration of acute actinomycotic infections caused by A. viscosus was temporarily extended by the presence of E. corrodens. The cellular inflammatory response and overall morphology of mixed experimental lesions containing A. israelii and E. corrodens did not appear to be significantly different from those of pure-culture lesions containing A. israelii alone. E. corrodens cells could not be readily discerned in stained histological sections of mixed experimental lesions.
TI  - Normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  - Bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 Danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. Thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml]. In 25% of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml. The microorganisms isolated most frequently were: Streptococcus, sp. ("Viridans group"), Veillonella parvula, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Lactobacillus, sp., Corynebacterium, sp., Actinomyces, sp., Bacteroides, sp., and Hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. The upper range for the number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. Enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and Enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  - Bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in children.
AB  - Children are more resistant to gingivitis than are adults. To determine possible  differences in their periodontal floras, an experimental gingivitis study, identical in design to one reported earlier with young adults, was conducted with four 4- to 6-year-old children. The incidence of sites that developed gingival index scores of 2 in children was less than one-third of the incidence observed in adults. The composition of the flora of each child was statistically significantly different from that of any other child or adult. The floras of the children as a group were statistically significantly different from those of the adults. Children had 3-fold greater proportions of Leptotrichia species, 2.5-fold greater proportions of Capnocytophaga species, 2.3-fold greater proportions of Selenomonas species, 2-fold greater proportions of bacterial species that require formate and fumarate, and 1.5-fold greater proportions of Bacteroides species. Adults had greater proportions of Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces WVa 963, Selenomonas D04, and Treponema socranskii were predominant species that correlated with increasing gingival index scores in both children and adults.
TI  - Human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  - In clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. This study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. Dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (BE) in buffer and pooled human serum (PHS) from pure cultures of Streptococcus sanguis. Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium sp and Veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. In addition, fractions of S sanguis culture fluids (CFs) from Sephadex G-10 chromatography were evaluated. All BE solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C and heat-inactivated prior to testing. All BEs in buffer attracted neutrophils, with the greatest responses seen to S sanguis and B intermedius followed by A viscosus. Migration to all BEs in PHS was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all BEs are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. A viscosus BE activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. CFs of S sanguis, A viscosus, and to a lesser degree, Fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. Evidence from [3H]FMLP competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that S sanguis CFs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. Of the bacteria associated with health, S sanguis and A viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. This observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased neutrophil transmigration in early disease.
TI  - Immunologic profile of juvenile periodontitis. I. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.
AB  - Studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (JP) patients have been inconclusive. Experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in JP and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were performed. Variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of DNA which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (LJP) and generalized (GJP) forms of JP patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y-4), Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochraceus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis and Treponema denticola. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (AMLR) were increased for LJP compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of GJP were decreased compared to healthy subjects and LJP (P less than 0.05). These observations indicate that GJP patients may have abnormalities in T- and B-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.
TI  - Production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  - Ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. Menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Two other Bacteroides species, Bacteroides disiens and Bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. A single isolate of Bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. These constituents were found in all of five strains of Escherichia coli, all of four strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of Propionibacterium species, two of five strains of Eubacterium species, and the one strain each of Arachnia propionica and Veillonella parvula tested. No menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptococcus, or Peptostreptococcus. These findings suggest that E. coli, Bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin K in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin K1.

TI  - Identification of bacteria in immunopathologic mechanisms of human dental pulp.
AB  - Serial frozen sections from human dental pulp were used for the identification of oral bacteria in immunopathologic mechanisms. Sera raised against Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Bacteroides gingivalis, and B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, commercial sera against human immunoglobulins, complement, and monoclonal antibodies against human T cells were used in a double-staining immunofluorescence technique. Sections of dental pulp from normal teeth showed no penetration of bacteria or bacterial antigens and no signs of inflammation. A unique aspect of the present study was the demonstration that penetrating bacteria and bacterial antigens in the pulp of involved teeth were always associated with antibodies and frequently also with complement. A. viscosus has been found most frequently in complement-fixing immune complexes followed by B. gingivalis. A. naeslundii and B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius were found only in complexes with antibodies. The involvement of plasma cells and T cells was also demonstrated. In the dental pulps of diseased teeth, cytotoxic and Arthus type immunopathologic reactions occurred.
TI  - Colonization of the subgingival area by Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - The initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by B. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and Gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. The level of B. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. Once B. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached Gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the B. gingivalis product, hematin. The bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented Bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. Melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against Actinomyces species. This was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of B. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. Various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by B. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. Since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.
TI  - Anaerobes as normal oral flora.
AB  - The human mouth provides a suitable habitat for numerous bacterial genera. Anaerobic genera or genera that include anaerobic members found in the oral cavity are Actinomyces, Arachnia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Leptotrichia, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, Selenomonas, Treponema, and Veillonella. The incidence of anaerobes varies with age of the individual and with specific sites sampled. In edentulous infants, the incidence of anaerobes is relatively low. In adults, anaerobes are invariably present but are more prevalent in samples from the gingival sulcus than they are in samples from the gingival margin, tooth surfaces, buccal mucosa, tongue, or saliva. In samples from the healthy gingival sulcus, anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli are found in the range of 5%-14%; gram-negative bacilli in the range of 13%-29%; Veillonella in the range of 2%-8%; and gram-positive cocci in the range of 1%-15% of the cultivable flora. From marginal plaque and plaque from the tooth surface, gram-positive bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and Veillonella appear to be the predominant anaerobes. In saliva, Veillonella are the most numerous anaerobes.
TI  - Specimen collection and transport, anaerobic culture techniques, and identification of anaerobes.
AB  - Excellent progress has been made in recent years in the development and refinement of technical materials used for transporting specimens and growing and identifying anaerobes. Several good systems for maintaining swabs and vials for transporting liquid specimens are commercially available. Anaerobic bags are useful for transporting unusual specimens, such as tissue or bone, and are also a convenient way to incubate small numbers of plates. Several different types of anaerobic chambers, with or without gloves, and separately enclosed incubators are being used by an increasing number of laboratories. Prereduced anaerobically sterilized plates and biochemicals in tubes are available from several commercial sources. A new rapid identification microsystem based on tests for performed enzymes permits identification of many clinically significant anaerobes to the species level in 4 hr.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in bone and joint infections.
AB  - The etiologic importance of anaerobic microorganisms in bone and joint infections in certain settings has recently been emphasized. These settings include recovery of Actinomyces species, hematogenously acquired infection, the presence of anaerobes in pure culture, and prosthetic-joint infection. Frequently, mixed aerobic-anaerobic bone or joint infection develops as a consequence of infection in adjacent areas. The incidence with which anaerobes are present in these settings is undoubtedly underestimated and may often be unappreciated in regard to the selection of therapeutic agents. Therefore, a practical approach to the treatment of infections involving anaerobes that is based on our current knowledge is necessary. Animal models are now available for study of anaerobic osteomyelitis. In conjunction with prospective human studies utilizing careful microbiologic techniques, it should be possible to determine the significance of anaerobic bacteria when a polymicrobial flora is present in bone and joint infections.
TI  - Anaerobic oral and dental infection.
AB  - Anaerobes make up a significant part of the oral and dental indigenous and pathogenic flora. Their role in periodontal disease, root canal infections, infections of the hard and soft oral tissue, as well as their importance as foci for disseminated infectious disease is well established. Despite the ubiquitous involvement of bacteria, significant progress in our understanding of specific microbial etiologies has occurred only in the past decade. Estimates of the number of species recovered from samples of subgingival plaque range from 250 to 400, a large portion made up by anaerobes. Common anaerobic isolates include Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Selenomonas, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, and Treponema. Recently, several significant advances in our knowledge have set the stage for future research. First, circulating levels of hormones in pregnant women were shown to be stimulatory to Bacteroides species, which were associated with increased levels of gingival infection. Second, bacterial invasion of the soft and hard periodontal tissues has been documented in gingivitis, advanced periodontitis, and localized juvenile periodontitis. The frequency and identity of invading bacteria will determine the implications for diagnosis and treatment. Third, antibacterial "probes" aimed at anaerobic (and capnophilic) bacteria have had promising results in controlling and arresting oral, dental, and peridontal anaerobic infections.
TI  - Osteomyelitis in dogs and cats caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Localised osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 2 dogs and 2 cats. The disease was caused by fight wounds in 3 cases. Radiographic examination demonstrated a circumscribed zone of cortical bone lysis, sequestra and periosteal new bone. Each case was treated surgically by sequestrectomy and debridement. Infection was due mainly to anaerobic bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria isolated from the lesions of dogs were Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides spp, and from the lesions in cats were Clostridium villosum , Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Wolinella recta and Bacteroides gingivalis. As all the bacteria were sensitive to penicillin, each case was treated with penicillin and by irrigation of the wound. This resulted in resolution of the disease, within 4 weeks, in all cases.

TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
TI  - Pathogenic synergy: mixed infections in the oral cavity.
AB  - In almost all infections in the oral cavity, mixed populations of bacteria are present. However, recent evidence points to a certain specificity in these infections: Streptococcus mutans is related to caries and black-pigmented Bacteroides species are suspected pathogens in periodontal disease. Periodontal diseases, endodontic infections and submucous abscesses in the oral cavity are probably mixed infections in which anaerobic bacteria together with facultatives or other anaerobes are present. In experimental mixed anaerobic infections black-pigmented Bacteroides strains have been shown to play a key role. Little is known about the pathogenic synergy between the bacteria involved in mixed infections. Important mechanisms could be nutritional interrelationships and interactions with the host defense. Within the group of black-pigmented Bacteroides B. gingivalis seems to be the most virulent species. These bacteria possess a great number of virulence factors, which might be important in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

TI  - Relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  - The predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. In the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (pO2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the pO2 was recorded. In addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. The oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmHg (1 mmHg congruent to 133.3 Pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmHg. Moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean pO2 of 15.7 mmHg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmHg found in the deeper pockets. The deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and Bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus mutans. The sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmHg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic Capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a pO2 greater than 15 mmHg. The presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with higher proportions of B. intermedius, Capnocytophaga sp., and A. naeslundii. These pO2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of pO2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.
TI  - Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  - Oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. Strains of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. Strains of B. intermedius, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and B. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. An overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. This suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. Pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of S. sanguis and A. viscosus and increased numbers of S. mutans. Analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the S. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. Absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl Sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. These observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. The data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.
TI  - In vitro activity of rodogyl against putative periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of Rodogyl (composite tablet of metronidazole and spiramycin), metronidazole-spiramycin mixture, spiramycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline were determined for selected putative periodontopathic microorganisms. Rodogyl was active against almost all strains, including Bacteroides species and the anaerobic spirochetes. Synergism of the component drugs in the Rodogyl combination was noted against Propionibacterium species. Spiramycin activity against Actinomyces species was enhanced in the presence of metronidazole.
TI  - Nonspecific induction of immunoglobulin M antibodies to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms after polyclonal human B-lymphocyte activation by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The production of antibodies to oral bacteria was determined in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with sonicated Fusobacterium nucleatum, a potent inducer of polyclonal B-cell activation. After 9 days the cultures were examined by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to F. nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Antibodies to these four bacteria were detected in cultures stimulated with polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing concentrations of F. nucleatum. However, significant concentrations of antibodies to F. nucleatum, but not to the other three microorganisms, were produced in cultures that received suboptimal polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing doses of F. nucleatum. Absorption studies indicated the specificity of the antibodies to each of the bacteria tested. IgM antibody production induced by F. nucleatum was enhanced by the addition of T cells. The production of IgM antibodies to the bacteria was reproducible in cultures from a single person tested on 3 consecutive days. The concentration of antibodies in replicate cultures, however, fluctuated greatly. To obtain consistent responses on successive days, multiple replicate cultures were required. These results suggest that F. nucleatum, which is frequently present in subgingival plaque, could induce the production of antibodies not only to F. nucleatum, but also to other microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases.
TI  - Bacterial IgG and IgM antibody titers in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - IgG AND IgM ANTIBODY TITERS to eight bacterial isolates were measured by indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA in sera from acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) patients during the acute phase, from ANUG patients during the convalescent phase, from patients with gingivitis and from subjects with normal gingiva. Subjects were matched with respect to age and sex. Compared to the gingivitis and healthy groups, the ANUG groups exhibited significantly higher IgG and IgM titers to intermediate-sized spirochetes and higher IgG titers to Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp intermedius. The findings support recent studies showing that these organisms are major bacterial components in ANUG lesions. They also suggest that these bacteria proliferate above-normal levels several weeks or months prior to the clinical onset of ANUG.
TI  - Fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activity in oral microorganisms.
AB  - Samples were taken from blood accumulated in dental alveoli after surgical removal of mandibular third molars, from subgingival plaque of teeth with advanced periodontal destructions, from teeth with infected necrotic pulps, and from subjects suffering from angular cheilitis. Of the microorganisms subcultured from these samples, 116 strains were assayed for enzymes degrading fibrinogen and fibrin. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen were assayed with the thin-layer enzyme assay cultivation technique. This assay involves the cultivation of microorganisms on culture agars applied over fibrinogen-coated polystyrene surfaces. Enzymes degrading fibrin were assayed with both a plate assay and a tube assay, in which fibrin was mixed with a microbial culture medium. Microorganisms degrading fibrinogen or fibrin or both were isolated from all sampling sites. Activity was mainly detected in strains of Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus aureus. Most Fusobacterium strains degraded fibrinogen only. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen as well as enzymes degrading fibrin via activation of plasminogen were revealed in strains of Clostridium, S. aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. It was generally found that fibrinogen was degraded by more strains than was fibrin, which indicates that different proteases may be involved.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - With the significant increase in resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in recent years, susceptibility testing of these organisms becomes very important. In addition to survey studies, hospitals should be determining their local patterns, and therapy of at least the more serious infections should be guided by susceptibility tests. Of the various tests available, those most suitable for smaller hospitals for guidance of patient management are the broth disc elution procedure and the micro broth dilution tray test.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Tinidazole--microbiology, pharmacology and efficacy in anaerobic infections.
AB  - Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole with selective activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. It is bactericidal at low concentrations and its spectrum covers most anaerobic bacteria and some capnophilic microorganisms. Anaerobic bacteria known to be resistant to tinidazole include anaerobic streptococci, actinomyces and propionibacteria. Tinidazole is one of the most active antibacterial agents against Bacteroides fragilis which is one of the most resistant species of anaerobic bacteria. Only a few strains have been reported to be resistant. Tinidazole has been shown to be efficacious in protozoal infections such as trichomonal vaginitis, amoebiasis and giardiasis. Clinical studies have also shown that tinidazole is efficacious in the treatment of anaerobic infections including respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal sepsis and obstetrical and gynecological infections. Since tinidazole has no activity against aerobic bacteria, it must be combined with other antibacterial agents in the treatment of mixed infections involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tinidazole has also been used successfully alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colonic and abdominal surgery, emergency appendectomy and gynecological surgery.

TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

AB  - The authors examined the feasibility of growing anaerobes in an automated microbiology system (MS-2) and using the system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 78 of 100 clinical anaerobic isolates grew in the MS-2 if 100 microL of an undiluted overnight suspension of organisms was inoculated into at least 2.5 mL of freshly prepared Wilkins-Chalgren broth supplemented with 0.07% agar. Susceptibility test results were determined with 50 anaerobes tested against seven antibiotics in the MS-2 system and were compared with results determined with a qualitative reference susceptibility test method. of the 350 tests, 88% of the MS-2 results agreed with the qualitative reference results. False-susceptible and false-resistant results were reported for 8.6 and 3.4%, respectively, of the MS-2 results.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of subgingival flora in patients with marginal periodontitis].
AB  - Before and 4 weeks after a single course of local treatment, the composition of subgingival microflora of 15 patients with marginal periodontitis was determined by cultural and microscopical examination. A significant reduction in the number of gram-negative microorganisms could be achieved by this treatment. Anaerobic sporeless rods like Bacteroides and Fusobacteria but also Spirochetes, Eikenella and Capnocytophaga were involved in the inflammation. The number of Actinomyces in the subgingival flora was also significantly reduced by therapy. After treatment the number of gram-positive bacteria like Streptococci and Corynebacteria was significantly increased. The reduction in the number of these gram-negative bacteria in line with the reduction of periodontal inflammation is a criterion of their significance in the etiology of marginal periodontitis.
TI  - Effect of Chinese and western antimicrobial agents on selected oral bacteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of selected oral bacteria, including suspected periodontopathogens, to a commonly employed Chinese herbal medicine Huang-chin (HC, Scutellaria baicalensis) was tested in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. HC was also compared with tetracycline, alexidine, and stannous fluoride. HC decoction, at a concentration of 2%, was bacteriostatic in eight of 11 bacteria tested, but a concentration of 3.13% or greater was required for bactericidal effect. Among the tested bacteria, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss intermedius was the most sensitive (MIC = 1.57%, MBC = 2%); Actinomyces viscosus was the least sensitive (MIC = 6.25%, MBC = 12.5%). Tetracycline, alexidine, and SnF2 were bactericidal in vitro in all bacteria tested at concentrations lower than those used clinically.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of human actinomykoses (author's transl)].
AB  - In the complex aetiology of human actinomykoses, various Actinomyces species, especially A. israelii, play the pathogenetically leading role in the mixed flora so typical for these diseases. A number of other microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria are also part of such mixed flora. Since these "concomitant" bacteria are themselves potentially pathogenic, it is important to have data on antibiotic sensitivity for the entire spectrum of microorganisms, to achieve effective and economic chemotherapy of human actinomykoses. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined for Actinomyces and the most important concomitant bacteria from actinomykotic processes: Actinobacillus actinomycetem-commitants, Bacteroides of the Melaninogenicus group, B. fragilis, B. theta-iotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium spp. and Propionibacteria. The results indicate that aminopenicillines are the drug of first choice, if in the actinomykoses there are no Bacteroides strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. These tests further indicate that clinically the combination of aminopenicillin and clindamycin, as well as aminopenicillin and metronidazol, are indicated. Minocycline and especially cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin, inhibit with few exceptions all bacteria which are potentially involved in actinomykotic processes.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  - Experimental infections in root canals with Streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (Strep-MC4). Actinomyces bovis (Act-MC6) and Bacteroides oralis (Bact-MC3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. The immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. The antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. In 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. After 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and histologically examined. The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. The cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. The radiographic and histologic examinations revealed no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number of teeth with periapical lesions. The radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. Histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. In the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. Mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  - Enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - Certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. To determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees C to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. This treatment markedly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus mutans MT3 and JBP and S. sanguis FC-1 and C5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of S. mitis RE7, Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and CK-8, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, or B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. Heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees C for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min or 100 degrees C for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. This indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of S. mutans and S. sanguis. Treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. Thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the S. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of S. sanguis FC-1 but not that of S. sanguis C5. Treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. Treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. Exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.
TI  - Recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  - L-phase (CWD) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. Two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) Type B CWD variants in equally low numbers. Organisms in group 1 were: Streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci, Lancefield Gp. G (2x); Staphylococcus aureus; Actinobacillus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Group 2 consisted of Bacteroides sp., Propionibacterium acnes, and three "Nocardia-like" sp. Catalase + Actinomyces was not recovered equally well on CWD plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. This occurred in spite of the fact that the CWD media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced L-phase variants of Nocardia caviae and N. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a Bacteroides L-phase variant from a pleural fluid. The nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.
TI  - Plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  - Eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. Microorganisms studied included: Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (B. gingivalis), B. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, Capnocytophaga ochracea (B. ochraceus), and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Three B. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 Mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. Restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. In other microorganisms, including the Actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.
TI  - Simple and convenient method for culturing anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A simple and convenient method for culturing anaerobic bacteria is described. Cultures can be grown in commercially available flasks normally used for preparation of sterile external solutions. A special disposable rubber flask closure maintains anaerobic conditions in the flask after autoclaving. Growth of a variety of anaerobic oral bacteria was comparable to that obtained after anaerobic incubation of broth cultures in Brewer Anaerobic Jars.
TI  - Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses of guinea-pigs to the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus is a Gram-positive facultative rod indigenous to most human  mouths. The guinea-pig was evaluated as a model for assessing cellular immune responses to a human strain of A. viscosus. Guinea-pigs, immunized with heat-killed A. viscosus cells or a water-soluble extract from A. viscosus (AVS), were tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to A. viscosus 4 weeks after immunization. A week later, the guinea-pigs were terminated. Lymphocytes from peripheral blood, lymph node and spleen were tested for in-vitro blastogenic responses to heat-killed A. viscosus or the water-soluble extract. Plasma from these guinea-pigs were tested for the presence of precipitating antibodies. Positive in-vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and antibody responses to AVS occurred only in immunized guinea-pigs. A strong in-vitro blastogenic response to AVS or heat-killed A. viscosus occurred in lymphocytes from immunized guinea-pigs, but a weak response was detected in un-immunized animals. These data suggest that the guinea-pig can be used to evaluate different parameters of the immune response to oral bacteria such as A. viscosus.
TI  - The development of an altered gingival crevicular microflora in the alloxan-diabetic rat.
AB  - The microflora of the rat gingival crevice were examined at various time intervals after inducing experimental diabetes. A variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci and short rods were isolated from the normal rat crevice. Within a week after alloxan administration, Leptotrichia buccalis was detected for the first time. Other features in the diabetic animals included an increased frequency of isolation of Proteus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and decrease of Escherichia coli. Occasionally, a decrease was also observed in Bacteroides spp. and Streptococcus spp. No difference was observed between diabetic and non-diabetic animals in the isolation of Selonomonas, Campylobacter, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. Plaque accumulation was markedly increased in the diabetic rats. It was concluded that the change in gingival microflora resulted from diabetes-induced alterations in the sulcular environment (such as increased substrate levels, e.g. glucose and urea, and decreased oxygen) and that the microbiological changes preceded the depending of the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity testing of anaerobes.
AB  - Most of the methods devised for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of aerobes  have been applied to anaerobes. In addition to the problems intrinsic to these methods, additional difficulties arise from anaerobiosis itself, from variability of carbon dioxide concentrations and pH, from problems in preparation and definition of inoculum, from the rich media required for growth by some fastidious anaerobes, and from the lack of suitable control microorganisms of known sensitivity. Among the procedures described, MIC determination on solid media is suitable for research and for use as a standard, and MIC in liquid media for routine use but disc tests are of limited usefulness. Changes in hitherto relatively stable patterns of susceptibility among anaerobes may well necessitate an increase of sensitivity testing in diagnostic laboratories.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Reference data on the overall resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria are needed since in individual clinical cases susceptibility testing is complicated by the long generation time and difficulties of test conditions. Benzylpenicillin and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice against Clostridium perfringens. Newer cephalosporins are also active, whereas other Clostridium species have been found resistant. Beta-lactam antibiotics show high activity against Peptococcaceae; resistance to clindamycin should be noted, however. The good in vitro activity of tetracyclines, clindamycin and erythromycin against Propionibacterium acnes could be confirmed in the systemic and local therapy of acne vulgaris. In contrast to gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, only some penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives are sufficiently active against gram-negative rods of the Bacteroides group. Sporadic resistance is seen to the newer tetrayclines, nitroimidazole compounds and to lincomycins. Nevertheless, these substances must be considered as standard therapeutics for infections caused by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. It should be mentioned that cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.
TI  - Influence of sublethal antibiotic concentrations on bacterial adherence to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The influence of growth in the presence of sublethal concentrations of nine antibiotics on the ability of certain potentially odontopathic bacteria to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces which mimic teeth was studied. Cells of Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and S2, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Capnocytophaga ochraceus 6, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans N27 attached in lower numbers to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite when grown in the presence of 50% of the minimum inhibitory concentration of tetracycline. Electron microscopic observations of negatively stained preparations indicated that tetracycline-grown A. viscosus LY7 cells had fewer fimbriae than did untreated cells, which may account for the impaired ability of the treated cells to attach. However, cells of Actinomyces naeslundii L13 and S4 attached in higher numbers when grown in the presence of tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, or neomycin. Streptococcus mutans strains H12 and JBP also exhibited increased adherence to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite when grown in the presence of 50 or 25% of the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin. Thus, growth in the presence of sublethal antibiotic concentrations could increase as well as decrease the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Antibiotic-grown cells of the Actinomyces strains showed enhanced hemagglutination activity, but this did not correlate with their ability to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in the growth media also affected the coaggregation reactions of several organisms; the effects were specific for one member of the coaggregation pair.

TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
TI  - Comparison of Marion's anaerobic culture/set-A and the Baltimore Biological Laboratory Gaspak anaerobic system in the cultivation and recovery of bacteria from human dental plaque.
AB  - Marion's anerobic culture/set-A (Bio-Bag A) and the Baltimore Biological Laboratory (BBL) Gaspak anaerobic system were evaluated for their efficiency in the cultivation and recovery of anaerobes and capnophilic organisms from human dental plaque samples. Both culture systems were relatively efficient in supporting the growth of pure culture of various bacterial species recently isolated from the human dental plaques. When the dental plaque samples were cultured the organisms commonly found were cultivatable in both culture systems. However, the counts and proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum from the samples were significantly higher in Marion's culture system, whereas the proportions of black-pigmented Bacteroides sp. were significantly higher in the BBL anaerobic system.

TI  - The maintenance of B-cell and T-cell function in frozen and stored human lymphocytes.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and test a convenient means for long-term storage of lymphocytes taken from clinically characterized patients without losing B- or T-cell function. Accordingly, peripheral blood lymphocytes were frozen and stored, and portions of each sample were subsequently assayed for T-cell blastogenic response and B-cell Jerne plaquing at various time intervals after freezing. A comparison of the cell counts of fresh and frozen cultures indicated that cell were recovered after freezing. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant differences in (i) cell viability; (ii) blastogenic response to antigens of Actinomyces maeslandii, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and tetanus toxoid; (iii) blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen; and (iv) polyclonal B-cell response to pokeweed mitogen as measured by the direct Jerne plaque assay. The retained blastogenic and plaquing responses seen in frozen cultures indicated the maintenance of both T-cell and B-cell function, respectively. This is the first reported demonstration of Jerne plaquing of normal human lymphocytes after freezing. It appears that freezing techniques provide a means for repeating and extending both T- and B-cell assays using frozen stored portions of the same cell samples.
TI  - Bacteriology of intracranial abscess in children.
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical findings in 19 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Ten children presented with subdural empyema and nine had brain abscess. Sinusitis was present in 14 children, and dental abscess in two. The abscess was located in the frontal and parietal area in seven instances each, and in the temporal area in five. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 12 (63%) of the patients (including eight with subdural empyema and four with brain abscess), aerobic bacteria alone were present in two children (11%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in five (26%) patients. There were 43 anaerobic isolates (2.3 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (16 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (10, including two B. fragilis); Fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and Actinomyces sp. (five isolates). A total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five Gram-positive cocci and three Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Five patients, four with sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - The predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of beagle dogs with periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant cultivable dental plaque flora was studied in 10 adult female beagle dogs with advanced periodontitis. Supragingival and subgingival plaque from a maxillary third premolar (P3) was removed and cultured anaerobically on various growth media and all colonies were subcultured and partially characterized. Histopathological specimens of the plaque sampling sites showed significant loss of connective tissue attachment. Spirochetes were found in all samples. Anaerobic gram-negative organisms were predominant in both types of plaque accounting for about 55% of the cultivable organisms in the supragingival plaque and almost 75% in the subgingival plaque. Bacteroides asaccharolyticus was the most predominant organism in the supragingival plaque, whereas Fusobacterium nucleatum predominated in the subgingival flora. Streptococcal and actinomycotic species were common in the supragingival plaque, but their proportions, especially those of the actinomycetes, were decreased in the subgingival flora. In many respects the bacterial profile associated with disease resembled that reported in human periodontal disease.

TI  - In vitro susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to nitroimidazoles.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 355 Swedish clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to three nitroimidazole drugs was determined by the agar dilution method. The drugs were metronidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. In addition the in vitro susceptibility of 32 strains of clostridium difficile to metronidazole was determined. Gram-negative rods and clostridia were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml or less of all three compounds except one strain of C. difficile, which was not inhibited by 16 microgram/ml of metronidazole. Against strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, tinidazole was slightly more active than metronidazole and ornidazole. Only about 70% of anaerobic cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml of the three drugs, whereas the remaining isolates were resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 8 microgram/ml). Anaerobic streptococci were not included in this material. Actinomyces, arachnia and propionibacteria were resistant to the nitroimidazole drugs. At achievable serum levels, nitroimidazoles inhibited the majority of anaerobic bacteria found with greatest frequency in anaerobic infections.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like substance (melaninocin) from oral Bacteroides melaninogenicus.
AB  - A bacteriocin-like substance, designated melaninocin, was extracted from a strain of Bacteroides melaninogenicus by ultrasonic treatment and purified. Melaninocin was heat labile and was destroyed by digestion by several proteolytic enzymes. Among the oral indigenous microorganisms, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, and streptococci were found to be sensitive to melaninocin.
TI  - Chemical and physical differentiation of superoxide dismutases in anaerobes.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase activity in crude or partially purified cell extracts from several species and strains of obligate anaerobe Bacteroides was inhibited instantaneously by NaN3 and was inactivated rapidly upon incubation with H2O2. The extent of NaN3 inhibition varied from 41 to 93%, and the half-life of the enzymatic activity in 5 mM H2O2 ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 min, depending upon the organism tests. When grown in a defined medium containing 59Fe, Bacteroides fragilis (VPI 2393) incorporated radiolabel into a 40,000-molecular-weight NaN3- and H2O2-sensitive superoxide dismutase but did not incorporate 54Mn into that protein under similar growth conditions. The anaerobe Actinomyces naeslundii (VPI 9985) incorporated 54Mn but not 59Fe into a NaN3-insensitive and H2O2-resistant superoxide dismutase. The apparent molecular weight of the superoxide dismutase from this and several other Actinomyces spp. was estimated to be 110,000 to 140,000. Comparison of these data with studies of homogeneous metallosuperoxide dismutases suggests that the Bacteroides spp. studied contain a ferrisuperoxide dismutase, whereas Actinomyces spp. contain a managanisuperoxide dismutase.

TI  - Lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  - We assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. When the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. The Actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas Streptococcus sanguis, Campylobacter, and Eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. The response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. However, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. These results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease states.
TI  - Modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  - The lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. In addition, a group of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in response to the same stimulants. The stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides [Capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). Intrinsic (cells cultured in male AB plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. Additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. There was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. We propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.
TI  - Comparison of moxalactam (LY127935) and cefotaxime against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of moxalactam (LY127935 [6059S]) and cefotaxime were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, carbenicillin, and penicillin by agar dilution susceptibility testing of a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Moxalactam proved to be the most active agent tested against Bacteroides fragilis and other species of the B. fragilis group. Moxalactam and cefotaxime showed activity similar to the other drugs against the remaining species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Veillonella. Penicillin was the most effective drug tested against most species of Clostridium, the anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Eubacterium lentum.
TI  - The effect of intensive antibacterial therapy on the sulcular environment in monkeys. Part I. Changes in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus.
AB  - The changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. Two Rhesus monkeys were scaled and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. Over the 40 day experimental period and 74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. The plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. The total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. The flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and Fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. During treatment B. melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. After cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but B. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  - A study of the bacteria associated with advancing periodontitis in man.
AB  - Samples of apical plaque were taken by means of an anaerobic gas-flushed syringe  from 21 sites in eight patients. The samples were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated and incubated in an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2 for 7-21 days. All colonies on plates containing 20-50 isolates were picked, repeatedly restreaked, characterized and identified where possible by a probabilistic computer identification program. The sites were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical features. The significance of differences between bacterial populations in the groups was determined by the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the rank correlation of clinical features of diseases and microbial species. The subgingival microbiota in advanced destructive sites was predominated by Gram-negative rods. The microbiota of two young adult patients with generalized extensive bone loss, extensive clinical inflammation and suppuration was dominated by Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and an organism with characteristics consistent with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The predominant cultivable microbiota in two patients with extensive bone loss but minimal clinical inflammation was predominated by Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in one patient and E. corrodens and a slow growing fusiform-shaped Bacteroides in a second patient. A third group of four patients demonstrated moderate levels of clinical inflammation and evidence of continued bone loss in the last year. Predominant organisms in this group were more heterogeneous and included B. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the "fusiform" Bacteroides and anaerobic vibrios. Sites with minimal disease in the patients revealed higher proportions of Gram-positive organisms including Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus. A positive rank correlation could be detected between clinical inflammation including suppuration and B. asaccharolyticus and a negative rank correlation between inflammation and E. corrodens.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in diseases of the dog and cat.
AB  - A survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. A total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. Common isolated included Actinomyces (9.1%), Clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other Clostridium spp (11.2%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other Bacteroides spp (17.6%), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). Anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. Antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. Data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. Clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. Induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antituberculosis agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic infections may coexist with tuberculosis, and can be mistaken for one another. The effect of therapy with antituberculosis chemotherapeutic agents against anaerobic bacteria (with the exception of rifampin) is unknown. We therefore examined the in vitro efficacy of certain commonly used antituberculosis agents (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) against 370 strains of anaerobic bacteria, including 86 isolates of Bacteroides fragilis. Rifampin at a concentration of 2 microgram/ml inhibited 91 percent of all anaerobic isolates. Both ethambutol and isoniazid were totally ineffective against any of the anaerobes tested, even at 64 microgram/ml. Therapy with rifampin in an unsuspected anaerobic infection can be misdiagnosed for tuberculosis. Therefore, when tuberculosis is suspected, isoniazid and ethambutol can be used and rifampin withheld until the acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated by additional diagnostic procedures, such as transtracheal aspiration.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue polymicrobial infections from intravenous abuse of drugs.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections were studied in 21 seriously ill narcotic addicts who had been admitted to hospital. Subcutaneous abscesses were present in 14 patients; cellulitis was noted in 3, pyomyositis in 2 and necrotizing fasciitis in 2. In four patients there was septicemia. Infections in 14 patients (66.6 percent) were associated with anaerobic bacteria, which were the exclusive isolates in 6 patients. In seven patients (33.3 percent) isolates were exclusively aerobic bacteria and in eight both aerobes and anaerobes were present. The anaerobic isolates were clostridia (six), peptostreptococci (five), bacteroides (five), peptococci (three), and one of each of Veillonella, Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium and Actinomyces. Staphylococcus aureus, generally thought to be the most common cause of subcutaneous infections in addicts, was found only in four (19 percent) patients. The other aerobic isolates were Klebsiella (five) and Enterobacter (four) species. When clinical features or the Gram stain of pus suggest that anaerobic bacteria may be present, antibiotic therapy should be directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria until culture results are available.
TI  - The role of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and other anaerobes in periodontal infections.
AB  - Recent taxonomic and anatomical studies of dental plaque associated with periodontal health and disease have demonstrated that differences in the microbial populations in plaque may be responsible for the initiation and progression of disease. The consistent isolation of large numbers of anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria from the depths of periodontal lesions has suggested an important role for these organisms. Bacteria that have been isolated include Capnocytophaga (Bacteroides ochraceus), other species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, spirochetes, Campylobacter, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Peptococcus, and other genera. The periodontopathic potential of oral strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus has been explored in a number of investigations because these organisms are consistently isolated from periodontal lesions. Studies of B. melaninogenicus have included purification of a capsular substance, characterization of the lipopolysaccharide and a variety of toxic substances and lytic enzymes, and ecologic aspects of its colonization. Understanding of the nature and pathogenic mechanisms of the oral microbiota may lead to control of this pandemic infection.
TI  - [Phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. A complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom : Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces sp., Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a Gram- bacteria related to group II j. The pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. This kind of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.

TI  - Comparative susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, ornidazole,  and SC-28538.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 284 anaerobic bacteria, including 55 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, were determined by an agar dilution technique to metronidazole and two newer nitroimidazoles, ornidazole and SC-28538. All three agents showed marked in vitro activity against virtually all anaerobic bacteria tested. At concentrations </=1 mug/ml, SC-28538 was significantly more active than either metronidazole or ornidazole. At concentrations of >1 mug/ml, the activities of all three agents were comparable. Propionibacterium and Actinomyces showed significant resistance to all three agents. Anaerobic and microaerophilic members of the genus Streptococcus were also often resistant, in contrast to Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus strains. In addition, the bactericidal activities of ornidazole and SC-28538 were determined against 27 strains of the B. fragilis group by a broth dilution technique. The minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of each agent were very close. At concentrations of </=0.5 mug/ml, SC-28538 showed greater bactericidal activity; at concentrations of >/=2 mug/ml, the activies of both agents were similar.
TI  - Bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  - The plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. When the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the Actinomyces sp. at the expense of the Streptococcus sp. In particular, the percentage of Actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. A. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. When the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, A. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but A. viscosus and Bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis developed. The availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. The bacteriological profile showed that when bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of A. viscosus and B. melaninogenicus increased significantly. These findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - Attachment of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  - This investigation examined the ability of cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal pockets. Of 48 asaccharolytic strains of B. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. Electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of B. melaninogenicus strains. Both asaccharolytic and fermentative B. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of several gram-positive bacteria tested, including Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. mitis. B. melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. Both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of B. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. Serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. These observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit the attachment of B. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. This was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of B. melaninogenicus 381-R were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. After 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. High numbers of B. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. These data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing Actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment and colonization of B. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. Similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.
TI  - Juvenile periodontitis (periodontosis).
AB  - Juvenile periodontitis, characterized by early age of onset, rapid rate of periodontal tissue destruction and selective tooth involvement in the absence of commensurate aetiological factors, is recognized as a distinct clinical entity. The present paper describes the clinical findings and some immunological characteristics in a group of thirty-four patients under the age of thirty. Clinical aspects studied included the influence of sex, race, family history and general health. Immunological findings relating to the level of immunoglobulins in serum and saliva, lymphocyte transformation in response to veillonella, bacteroides, fusobacterium and actinomyces species and to ultrasonicated plaque, and the inhibition of macrophage migration by these antigens. Differences were shown to exist between those patients below the age of 22 years and the group aged 23-29 years.

TI  - The predominant cultivable microflora of advanced periodontitis.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms harbored in the base of deep periodontal pockets of eight patients aged 34-48 years was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. From a total of 475 isolates, 425 (89.5%) were obligate anaerobes, 356(74.9%) were Gram-negative, and 441(92.8%) were categorized as rods. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium nucleatum constituted the majority of the isolates in seven samples, but their mutual proportions differed considerably between the samples. One sample was dominated by Actinomyces species. Some periodontopathic potentials of the predominating Gram-negative rods are summarized.
TI  - Blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: characterization of bacterial sonicates.
AB  - Soluble sonicate supernatant preparations were made from Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 19246), A. naeslundii (ATCC 12104), two strains of Veillonella alcalescens (strain HV-1 and a human oral isolate), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10556), S. mutans (strain 6715-T2), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (strain K110), and Leptotrichia buccalis (isolated from human dental plaque). These supernatants were characterized with reference to their chemical and antigenic components and their biological activity determined by using in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis as a measure of the host's cellular immune response. The sonicate supernatant of each bacterium contained protein, neutral sugars, methylpentose, and nucleic acids. Protein was the major component in all except L. buccalis, in which neutral sugars predominated. The antigenic components in each supernatant were detected by using rabbit antisera prepared against the whole bacteria and the sonicate supernatant. The supernatants showed a complex antigenic distribution on immunoelectrophoretic analysis. The supernatants were shown to be antigenic and not mitogenic in nature, since neither cord blood lymphocytes nor all adult lymphocytes were stimulated. The supernatant antigen preparations showed a reproducible, dose-dependent, and kinetic response in vitro, which was similar to that seen with the antigen preparation streptokinase-streptodornase.
TI  - Blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: comparison  of individuals with periodontal disease to normal and edentulous subjects.
AB  - Cell-mediated immunity in humans to antigens derived from oral plaque bacteria was investigated by using the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. Subjects with varying severities of periodontal disease including normal, gingivitis, periodontitis, and edentulous were compared. Mononuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood and cultured with antigens prepared by sonication of Actinomyces viscosus (AV), Actinomyces naeslundii (AN), Veillonella alcalescens (VA), Leptotrichia buccalis (LB), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM), and homologous dental plaque (DP). The lymphocyte response of subjects with gingivitis or periodontitis was significantly greater than that of normal subjects to antigens of AV, AN, and DP, but did not differ from the response of edentulous subjects. Periodontitis subjects were significantly more reactive than edentulous and normal subjects in response to VA, LB, and BM. These findings suggest that the tested gram-negative bacteria and the host response they evoke are associated with advanced periodontal destruction.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
TI  - Cigarette smoking and the microbial flora of the mouth.
AB  - A range of selective media was used to culture the microbial flora of the dental  plaque, tongue and palate, The subjects were five young men who smoked more than twenty cigarettes a day and four who did not smoke. Neisseriae were less numerous on the mucosal surfaces of the smokers.
TI  - The predominant cultivable organisms in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative examinations of the predominant cultivable microflora of the advanced tissue destruction (pocket) associated with juvenile periodontitis and of control pockets without loss of attachment were carried out by using anaerobic tube culture technique. The microflora from the control sites consisted primarily of streptococci, Gram-negative rods, and Gram-positive rods. In contrast, the test pockets had a relatively stable and characteristic microflora, dominated by various Gram-negative, anaerobic rods. The Gram-negative rods were divided into main groups, but a satisfactory classification of many of these microorganisms could not be performed with the methods used and the data available. The predominating Gram-negative rods differed from individual to individual. The role of the Gram-negative rods in the etiology of juvenile periodontitis is unknown. Some potential pathogenic mechanisms of these microorganisms are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of a test kit for identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A test kit for identification of anaerobic bacteria--API--has been compared for accuracy in individual tests and for identification on the genus or species level with pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized media methods on 241 anaerobic strains. The microsystem was found to be reliable and permits identification of the clinically most significance anaerobic bacteria if it is supplemented with other tests such as gaschromatographic analysis, morphology, lecithinase, lipase and antibiotic sensitivity pattern.
TI  - Dextranases from oral bacteria: inhibition of water-insoluble glucan production and adherence to smooth surfaces by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The effect of dextranases (EC 3.2.1.11) from the oral isolates Actinomyces israelii and Bacteroides ochraceus on water-insoluble glucan production by the Streptococcus mutans dextransucrase (EC 2.4.1.5) and sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth glass surfaces by S. mutans was studied. Collection on membrane filters of water-insoluble polysaccharides synthesized from radioactive sucrose was used to demonstrate the marked sensitivity of insoluble glucan formation to the presence of dextranase. Concentrations of A. israelii dextranase as low as 0.002 U/ml inhibited insoluble glucan formation by 60%. Similar results were obtained the the B. ochraceus enzyme. An assay for sucrose-stimulated adherence of S. mutans to smooth surfaces involved attachment of radioactively labeled nongrowing cells to the bottom of glass scintillation vials. This facile and sensitive assay was utilized to demonstrate that sucrose-dependent adherence was affected by low levels of dextranase from either A. israelii or B. ochraceus. Enzyme at 0.005 U/ml reduced adherence of S. mutans by 80%. Treatment of S. mutans cells previously attached to glass with low concentrations of the dextranases resulted in removal of 50% to 60% of the bacteria. The results indicate that dextranase-producing oral bacteria may affect sucrose-dependent colonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface and offer a possible explanation for both the difficulties involved in implanting this bacterium into the human mouth and the limited intraoral transmission of S. mutans from one tooth surface to another.

TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  - Detection and preliminary studies on dextranase-producing microorganisms from human dental plaque.
AB  - An enriched nutrient agar medium containing blue dextran has been utilized for the detection of dextranase-producing microorganisms in human dental plaque. When compared with the total viable anaerobic plaque flora, the proportion of these microbes in supragingival plaque from different individuals varied over a wide range. Preliminary characterization of some of the dextranase-producing microorganisms revealed a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with varying morphological and biochemical characteristics. Several bacterial isolates were tentatively identified as being members of the genus Actinomyces. An additional isolate appeared to belong to the genus Bacteroides. The dextran-degrading enzymes produced by these bacteria are extracellular, and a cell-free preparation from one of the isolates has been shown to cause extensive endohydrolytic cleavage of high-molecular-weight dextrans.
TI  - Non-otogenic cerebral abscess.
AB  - Non-otogenic cerebral abscess is becoming relatively more frequent compared with  otogenic. It arises in a setting of sepsis, trauma, or congenital heart disease. The onset presents a meningo-encephalitic picture, often with two stages, followed by epilepsy and/or a hemiparesis. The best investigations are an EEG and, probably, an isotope scan. The angiogram may be misleading as 40% may not have a midline shift. 'Acute localized non-suppurative encephalitis' seems to be more frequent than in the past. Antibiotics and aspiration appear to be the best treatment.
