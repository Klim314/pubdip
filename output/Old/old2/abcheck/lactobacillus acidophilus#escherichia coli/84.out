biodegradable gelatin-chitosan films incorporated with essential oils as antimicrobial agents for fish preservation.
essential oils of clove (syzygium aromaticum l.), fennel (foeniculum vulgare miller), cypress (cupressus sempervirens l.), lavender (lavandula angustifolia), thyme (thymus vulgaris l.), herb-of-the-cross (verbena officinalis l.), pine (pinus sylvestris) and rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis) were tested for their antimicrobial activity on 18 genera of bacteria, which included some important food pathogen and spoilage bacteria.
clove essential oil showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by rosemary and lavender. in an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of these essential oils as food preservatives, they were also tested on an extract made of fish, where clove and thyme essential oils were the most effective.
then, gelatin-chitosan-based edible films incorporated with clove essential oil were elaborated and their antimicrobial activity tested against six selected microorganisms: pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrefaciens, photobacterium phosphoreum, listeria innocua, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus.
the clove-containing films inhibited all these microorganisms irrespectively of the film matrix or type of microorganism. in a further experiment, when the complex gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil was applied to fish during chilled storage, the growth of microorganisms was drastically reduced in gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteria, while lactic acid bacteria remained practically constant for much of the storage period.
the effect on the microorganisms during this period was in accordance with biochemical indexes of quality, indicating the viability of these films for fish preservation.
