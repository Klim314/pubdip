antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method.
all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium.
however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition.
l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk.
s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples.
these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
