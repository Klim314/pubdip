d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product.
we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa.
when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion.
d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight.
moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa.
d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability.
based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
