[in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization.
our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans.
the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01).
the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
