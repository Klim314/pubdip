bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria.
such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection.
such problems demand new strategies for solution.
use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.
cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media.
out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus.
both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively.
suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively.
bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min.
function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
