[influence of corynebacteria metabolites on antagonistic activity of h2o2 producing lactobacilli].
aim: study combined influence of corynebacterium genus bacteria metabolites and h2o2 producing lactobacilli on survival rate of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus.
materials and methods: the ability to inhibit catalase of the test strains used and to reduce bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical were determined in corynebacteria.
h2o2 containing metabolites were obtained by cultivating lactobacilli in mineral medium, the amount of h2o2 was determined by oxidation of tmb by peroxidase.
bactericidal effect of lactobacilli metabolites for test strains treated by corynebacteria metabolites was evaluated by seeding results. results.
inhibitio by corynebacteria metabolites of s. aureus catalase activity by 30-40% and e. coli catalase activ ity by 40-70% was shown.
a reduction of bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radicals by corynebacteria metabolites by 30-35% for s. aureus, 38-42% for e. coli and 70-73% for l. acidophilus was noted.
the enchantment of bactericidal effect of lactobacilli after treatment of the test strain by corynebacteria metabolites against s. aureus and e. coli manifested by reduction of the numbe of viable cells by 2-3 lg cfu. for l. acidophilus the bactericidal effect oflactobacilli metabolite in the same conditions reduced, and that led to the increase ofviability by 2-4 lg pfu.
conclusion: a conclusion on the possibility of regulation by associative bacteria the manifestations of antagonistic activity of h2o2 producing dominant microorganisms is made based on the data obtained.
