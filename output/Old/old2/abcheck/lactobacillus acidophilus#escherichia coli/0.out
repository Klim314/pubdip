murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography.
the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured.
all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
