growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg).
the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis.
the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum.
among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
