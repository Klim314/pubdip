increased antibody production against gut-colonizing escherichia coli in the presence of the anaerobic bacterium peptostreptococcus.
germ-free rats were colonized with e. coli alone, or with e. coli plus lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, peptostreptococcus.
the presence of peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of e. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to e. coli antigen. whereas the immunoglobulin g (igg) anti-e. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin m (igm) isotype represented true anti-e. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by l. acidophilus or peptostreptococcus but could with e. coli.
we suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.
