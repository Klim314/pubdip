lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant k99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
the most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli(etec).
colonization of etec in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. in the present study we have engineered lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant k99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs.
the expression of k99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using sds-page, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. to evaluate a function of the k99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs.
the tests showed that recombinant l. acidophilus, not control l. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against k99+ e. coli in a dose dependent manner. in conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant k99 fimbriae producing l. acidophilus was able to prevent e. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
