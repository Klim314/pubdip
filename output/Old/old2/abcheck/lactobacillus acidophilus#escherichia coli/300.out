competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture.
heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner.
since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
