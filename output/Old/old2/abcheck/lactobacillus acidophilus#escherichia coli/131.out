bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
antagonistic activities of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21), l. casei atcc 27216, and l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards e. coli strain k12, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis test cultures were studied.
the bactericidal effect of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (ph 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent.
adhesion of c. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
