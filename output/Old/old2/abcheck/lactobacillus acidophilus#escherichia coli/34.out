hydrolysates of glycated and heat-treated peanut 7s globulin (ara h 1) modulate human gut microbial proliferation, survival and adhesion.
aims: evaluation of an effect of glycation of ara h 1 on proliferation and survival rate and adhesion of intestinal enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus.
methods and results: pure ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (g37, g60 and c145 degrees c) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis.
impacts of ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: dapi, live/dead staining and fish.
examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of e. coli and ent.
faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival.
maillard reaction (mr, glycation) of ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate.
hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees c with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering e. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera lactobacillus and enterococcus.
conclusions: ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion.
significance and impact of the study: reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees c, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.
