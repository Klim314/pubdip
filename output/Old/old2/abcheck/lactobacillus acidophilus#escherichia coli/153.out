inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus lysates on the cytotoxic activity of shiga-like toxin 2 produced from escherichia coli o157:h7.
aims: the purpose of this study was to characterize the degree to which four cell lysates obtained from lactobacillus acidophilus strains affected the cytotoxic activity of escherichia coli o157:h7 in vitro and in vivo.
methods and results: in a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding elisa assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of l. acidophilus a4 and 30sc (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. in particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of e. coli o157:h7, under the presence of the cell lysates of l. acidophilus a4, was observed by killing assay of caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model.
conclusions: according to our results, l. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of stx-2 produced from e. coli o157:h7.
significance and impact of the study: the cell lysates of l. acidophilus can be applied to a variety of foods, and can be used as adjuncts for the inhibition of stx-2-mediated cytotoxicity.
