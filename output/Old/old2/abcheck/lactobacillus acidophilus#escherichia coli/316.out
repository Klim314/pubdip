impact of lactobacillus acidophilus on the normal intestinal microflora after administration of two antimicrobial agents.
twenty healthy volunteers participated in a comparative study concerning the influence of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the normal intestinal microflora after the administration of two antimicrobial agents, enoxacin and clindamycin, respectively. l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml to ten of the volunteers immediately after the administration of the antimicrobial agents. on the seventh day of enoxacin administration enterobacteria were eliminated in nine of ten subjects.
enterococci disappeared or decreased significantly in five subjects. during the l. acidophilus supplementation, there was a significant increase in the number of escherichia coli in one subject, while enterococci returned to the same level as before enoxacin administration in all subjects.
