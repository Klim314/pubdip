[hydrogen peroxide produced by lactobacillus species as a regulatory molecule for vaginal microflora].
a total of 33 strains of lactobacillus belonging to 9 species, isolated from vagina, were tested for production of hydrogen peroxide.
we observed that the following species: l. delbrueckii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii and l. gasseri dominated over other species in secretion of hydrogen peroxide to the growth medium.
concentration of this substance amounted from 0.05 to 1.06 mm (in case of strong aeration the concentration increased up to 1.8 mm).
moreover, killing properties of the pure hydrogen peroxide exerted toward escherichia coli and candida albicans were less prominent than these of the supernatants of cultures of lactobacillus strains producing h2o2.
