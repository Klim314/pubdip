biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease.
characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products.
we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora.
growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora.
however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions.
the inhibitory effect was dose dependent.
these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
