an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea.
however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea.
methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria.
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium.
results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria.
the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution.
conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
