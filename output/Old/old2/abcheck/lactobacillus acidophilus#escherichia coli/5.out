preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated.
results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively.
many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope.
furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli.
furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively.
micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
