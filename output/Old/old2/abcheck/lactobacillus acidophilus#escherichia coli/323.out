[effect of the administration of killed lactobacillus acidophilus on the survival of suckling mice infected with a strain of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli].
after oral administration of 10(2) to 10(5) cfu of escherichia coli b41 (0101:k 99+:st+) to 24-48 h old suckling mice (swiss of1), a 80 to 100% mortality rate is observed within three days.
we compared the effect of the oral treatment with a lyophilized preparation of heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus and with sterile water on the mortality rate of newborn mice. in six out of seven assays, the heat-killed l. acidophilus administration extended survival of infected suckling mice (p ranging from 0.019 to less than 0.001). in another test, result was contradictory.
a global analysis indicated that the two treatments were statistically different (p less than 0.001).
lactic acid was unable to induce protection.
