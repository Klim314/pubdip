released exopolysaccharide (r-eps) produced from probiotic bacteria reduce biofilm formation of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
here, we characterized released-exopolysaccharides (r-eps) from lactobacillus acidophilus a4 with the goal of identifying natural compounds that represses biofilm formation. in plastic 96-well microplates that contained 1.0 mg/ml of r-eps, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) biofilms were dramatically decreased by 87% and 94% on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (pvc) surfaces, respectively. in the presence of r-eps, neither their growth rate nor their autoinducer-2-like activity was affected on the ehec o157:h7.
importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-eps was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. in addition, we found that adding r-eps significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csga, and csgb) and chemotaxis (chey) in transcriptome analysis.
furthermore, these r-eps could prevent biofilm formation by a wide range of gram-negative and -positive pathogens.
this property may lead to the development of novel food-grade adjuncts for microbial biofilm control.
