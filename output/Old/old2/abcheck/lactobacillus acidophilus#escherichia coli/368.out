nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats.
the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity.
nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid.
these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.
