heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern.
heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner.
this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site.
a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
