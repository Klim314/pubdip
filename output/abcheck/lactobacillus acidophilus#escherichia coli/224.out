selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method.
the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis.
the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid.
the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested.
two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid.
weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus.
the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis, b. longum, or l. acidophilus.
cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid.
these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.
