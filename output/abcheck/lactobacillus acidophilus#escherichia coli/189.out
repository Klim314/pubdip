testing two lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus t-135 and lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, salmonella enteritidis and bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion.
both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
