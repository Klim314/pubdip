growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms.
lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production.
growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz.
kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus.
optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth.
however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth.
under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli.
these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
