live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit salmonella typhi and escherichia coli adherence to caco-2 cells.
a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells.
three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity.
all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent.
the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01).
the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria.
the inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01).
the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
