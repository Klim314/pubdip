effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor contents in broilers.
this experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers.
a total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex ross 308 broilers with an initial average bw of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (con), (2) con + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) con + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p1), and (4) con + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p2).
broilers fed the p1 and p2 diets had greater bw gain than broilers fed the con diet during d 22 to 35 (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02).
feed conversion ratios in p1 and p2 were decreased (p = 0.03) compared with that in con from d 22 to 35.
ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of his and phe, were increased (p < 0.05) in p1 and p2 compared with con.
serum iga and igm concentrations in p2 were higher (p < 0.05) than those in con.
the cecal lactobacillus numbers were increased (p = 0.02), and the counts of escherichia coli were decreased (p = 0.03) in p1 and p2 compared with con.
dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) the excreta nh3 content compared with the con. in conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity.
furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of e. coli and decreased the nh3 content of excreta.
