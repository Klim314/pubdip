yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec).
mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7.
the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af.
ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af.
tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157.
the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
