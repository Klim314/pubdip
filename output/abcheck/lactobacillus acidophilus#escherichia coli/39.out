impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility.
this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated.
the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility.
therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample.
six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments.
the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time.
also, the ph was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min.
the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile.
although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time.
broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease.
however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
