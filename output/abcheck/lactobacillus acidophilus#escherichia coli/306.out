population of salmonella serovar typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens with escherichia coli and intestinal bacteria.
to test the interaction between various species of bacteria and salmonella serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), the population of s. typhimurium was measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens in the presence of escherichia coli (e. coli) and one of the four intestinal bacteria; lactobacillus acidophilus.
clostridium perfringens, bifidobacterium thermophilum and bacteroides vulgatus.
competitive exclusion of s. typhimurium by di-flora chicken was not demonstrated. but the population of s. typhimurium was temporarily suppressed in di-flora chickens with e. coli and l. acidophilus. in penta-flora chickens with e. coli and these four intestinal bacteria, the population of s. typhimurium was suppressed for only 2 days. in normalized chickens, the population of s. typhimurium was markedly suppressed.
