effects of citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
1. the present study was conducted to develop citrus junos probiotics (cjp), using by-products of citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including saccharomyces cerevisiae, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus and bacillus subtilis.
the effects of dietary cjp on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated.
2. a total of 240 one-day-old ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g cjp/kg diet) in a completely randomised design.
3. dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg cjp significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period.
4. serum immunoglobulin (ig)m concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg cjp, whereas the igg and iga concentration remained unaffected. in addition, 20 g/kg cjp significantly inhibited proliferation of escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of lactobacillus or bacillus spp.
5. a significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary cjp.
6. thus, the results suggest that cjp up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal e. coli and tbars values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.
