casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized.
these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek.
these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
