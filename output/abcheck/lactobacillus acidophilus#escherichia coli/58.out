efficacy of a vaccine and a direct-fed microbial against fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in a randomized pen-level field trial of commercial feedlot cattle.
our primary objective was to determine the efficacy of a siderophore receptor and porin proteins-based vaccine (vac) and a lactobacillus acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (dfm) against fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in commercial feedlot cattle fed a corn grain-based diet with 25% distiller's grains.
cattle projected to be on a finishing diet during the summer were randomly allocated into 40 study pens within ten blocks based on allocation dates.
blocks were complete; each of the four pens within a block was randomly assigned one treatment: control, vac, dfm, or vac+dfm.
the dfm was fed (10(6)cfu/animal/day of lactobacillus) throughout the study periods (84-88 days) and cattle were vaccinated at enrollment and again three weeks later.
fresh fecal samples (30/pen) from pen floors were collected weekly for four consecutive weeks (study days 52-77).
two concurrent culture procedures were used to enable estimates of e. coli o157:h7 shedding prevalence and prevalence of high shedders. from 4800 total samples, 1522 (31.7%) were positive for e. coli o157:h7 and 169 (3.5%) were considered high shedders.
pen-level linear mixed models were used for data analyses.
there were no significant interactions among treatments and time of sampling.
however, vaccinated pens had lower (p<0.01) overall prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 (model-adjusted mean +/- sem=17.4 +/- 3.95%) and lower (p<0.01) prevalence of high shedders (0.95 +/- 0.26%) than unvaccinated pens (37.0 +/- 6.32% and 4.19 +/- 0.81%, respectively).
there was no evidence of a dfm effect on either measure of e. coli o157:h7 shedding.
results indicate that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine significantly reduces fecal prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 (vaccine efficacy of 53.0%) and prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 high shedders (vaccine efficacy of 77.3%) in commercial feedlot cattle reared in the summer on a finishing diet with 25% distiller's grains.
