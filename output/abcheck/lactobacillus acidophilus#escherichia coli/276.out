antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica.
however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed.
antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
