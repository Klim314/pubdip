lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora exerts activity against brush border damage promoted by a diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli in human enterocyte-like cells.
background and aims: the normal gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens.
the aim of this study was to examine whether lactobacilli, a minor genus of the resident gut microflora, exerts a protective effect against the cellular injuries promoted by the diarrhoeagenic afa/dr diffusely adhering escherichia coli (afa/dr daec) c1845 strain in human intestinal cells.
methods: cultured human intestinal fully differentiated enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells were used.
antibacterial activity was examined by measuring the viability of the adhering c1845 bacteria.
the distribution of brush border associated cytoskeleton and functional proteins was examined by immunofluorescence labelling coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis.
results: the activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb isolated from the resident human gastrointestinal microflora was examined.
a dose dependent decrease in viability of c1845 bacteria was observed after both direct contact in vitro between the spent culture supernatant (lb-scs) and the bacteria, and when the bacteria were adherent on caco-2/tc7 cells.
protection against the c1845 induced alterations in expression of f-actin, sucrase-isomaltase, dipeptidylpeptidase iv, alkaline phosphatase, and fructose transporter alterations was observed when the cells were exposed to lb-scs.
conclusion: l acidophilus strain isolated from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora, together with its antimicrobial activity, exerts a protective effect against the brush border lesions promoted by the diarrhoeagenic afa/dr daec strain c1845.
